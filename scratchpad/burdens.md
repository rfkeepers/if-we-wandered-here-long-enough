# Burdens

> NOTE: this is all straight out of DW2 blue, more or less.

- Hunted: The GM may always ask “Who’s keeping watch?”, even when you’re supposedly safe.
- Rushed: Every player crosses off 1 type of supply from their access.
- Unlucky: Once per session the GM may introduce a twist, danger, or obstacle, no matter the situation.
- Conspicuous: Everyone is aware of your party's presence.  All actions inevitably lead back to you.


### Burden Treatments

(stolen, needs a rewrite)

**Rally Together**

When you finish a concrete action as a group to redress a marked burden, ask the GM if they agree it's been addressed or resolved. If they do, clear out the burden.

- Hunted: confront with your hunters, pay off their organization, get out of town, put the target on someone else's head.
- Rushed: take a long delay to get your affairs in order, pay an extra wealth per character to Prepare while enjoying downtime, go out of your way to procure extra supplies.
- Unlucky: refuse a significant reward, allow the gm three unlucky moments in a single session, perform a grand and selfless deed for the benefit of others, engage in a strange and dangerous detoxification ritual.
- Conspicuous: spend some time under the radar doing nothing, change your identities, establish a community presence that counters your misdeeds.
