##### **Woods-Witch**:

All the flowers, fungus, herbs, and roots of the world heed your call.  Pick two from below and those plants, when grown, will gain the specified properties..  When you advance this feature, select another from the list.

- **Forget-me-not**: When steeped into a tea, induces a vivid hallucination of a forgotten memory.  Treat or cause a Condition.
- **Witch's Butter**: When turned into a paste and applied to the skin, causes a person to look older or younger, as wanted.
- **Devils Tooth**: Only grows on fresh, open wounds.  Staunches bleeding and seals the skin.  Reduces Broken Injury to a Wound.  If all Wounds are already marked the Injury stays but the bearer can now act without aid.
- **Mandrake**: A foot-tall tuber-creature that will do your bidding for an hour or so, before it dies with a shrill screech.
- **Henbane**: When burned- and the fumes inhaled- lightens the body and allows the affected to walk on water or fall short distances without much impact.
- **Hellebore**: Worn as a necklace, protects from one magical effect against the wearer, then immediately withers.
- **Monkshod**: When consumed, the eater is guaranteed to die in 24 hours.
- **Foxglove**: Sit silently and patiently near the plant for an hour or two, and it will entice a local spirit or spectre for conversation.
