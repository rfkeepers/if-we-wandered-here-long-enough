# Stats

- Force
- Intuit
- Maneuver
- Tempt

# Description

These stats describe _how_ your character goes about solving their
problems.  The better at a given stat a character is, the more
successful they are at reaching effective solutions with that
approach.  It's all about the character's preferred process, not
their innate capabilities, or the intended results.  Those parts
get covered by other systems.

In play it should flow like this:

1. Start with the fiction: what is the character _actually doing_?
Show their behavior to the camera, and then look to the rules to
determine if a move has triggered.
2. Engage a Move: if a move is triggered, follow the guidelines of
the move to determine which, if any, stats may be used to match the
fiction.
3. Pick the right stat for the move: if the move offers multiple
options for stats, pick the one that best fits the character's
actions.  Refer to what happened in 1/ for guidance.  The things
that the character actually did in the fiction should dictate the
choice of stats.  Remember, the stat represent the approach that
the characters' take.  It's about picking best representation of
the fiction, not the best benefit to the roll.
4. Find out what happens: the outcome should ideally match the
successes and fallouts of the stat itself.

## Force

Characters that solve problems with force want to bend the world
to their will.  They prefer the shortest path to their goals, and
will often ignore or disregard the potential downsides to their
approach.  The only thing that matters what they want is what
happens.

Force is often used to:
- Break things.
- Take things.
- Make demands or set ultimatums.
- Command attention or obedience.
- Weather storms or burdens.
- Ignore pain.
- Resist movement.

## Intuit

Characters that rely on intuition are- in many ways- the opposite
of their forceful counterparts.  They pay attention to what the
world around them needs, not what they need out of the world.  They
prefer to draw out opportunities that are already present, if only
one is able to pay attention to how all the threads are connected.

Characters often intuit solutions to:
- Peoples' motivations.
- Situational context.
- Secrets and hidden information.
- Delivering information appropriately.
- Giving others what they need.
- Bringing others to an understanding.
- Tempting others with what they want.

## Maneuver

Sometimes it won't matter how much you know about the situation
or how much muster you can throw at it.  A light touch can tip any
scale.  Maneuvers are about doing things exactly the right way- no
more and no less.  Maneuverable characters tend to base their
methods on one or more prior skills: expertise they've trained and
honed to perfection, or for which they have natural talent.

A well executed maneuver can:
- Entertain an audience.
- Hit the bullseye or weak point.
- Pick a lock.
- Craft an item.
- Write an iron-clad contract.
- Duck and weave through an obstacle course.

## Trick

Tricksters love indirection above all else.  If it puts them in
harm's way, comes back to bite them, places a target on their head,
or makes them a debtor, they'd rather avoid it altogether.  They're
all about getting what they want while avoiding payment or punishment.

Characters can play a trick to:
- Sneak around.
- Pick a pocket.
- Perform sleight of hand.
- Lie convincingly.
- Sell a bad idea.
- Wile out of responsibilities.
- Redirect attention.

# Behavior Vs Ability

There are two kinds of rpg stats: those that describe a character's
abilities (ie: what they are and what they can do), and those that
describe a character's behavior (ie: how they act during a conflict).
This system is, of course, the latter.  It focuses on what how well
the characters do what they do.

In actual play, behavior-based design can get more complicated than
ability-based ones. Ability-driven characters leverage their ability
(a constant) to direct the fictional outcome: `Ann uses her strength
to force open the door.` A strong character is always strong; their
strength was leveraged to apply force. `Action +/- Ability = Result`.
Simple formula.

Changing the operational verb from `Strength` to `Force` doesn't
necessarily remove the ??????

# Examples

## Example cases

### Bar Fight

Scene: Late in a seedy tavern, two drunkards in a shouting match
rise from their table and begin to scuffle.  The innkeep steps in
to intervene.

- **Force**: Grabbing the nearest drunkard by the collar in one
hand and the belt in the other, the innkeep drags them to the
door and throws them onto the street.

- **Force**: The innkeep pulls out a cudgel and thumps it on the
table.  "No one starts a fight in my tavern unless they want
me to end it for them.  You'll both stop this, or you'll leave."

- **Maneuver**: The innkeep ducks between the blows and catches
each drunkard in a headlock.  Pinned as they are, the brawlers
are unable to continue their fight.

- **Tempt**: The innkeep rushes to the door, pauses to listen, and
then turns to the room, shouting, "someone out there is calling
for the city guard!  If the guards show up then we're closing up
for the night. You all better get these two under control." It's
a lie, but an effective one.

- **Intuit**: One of the brawlers recently lost their brother
in the war; they've been prickly ever since, ready to fight at
any mention of the king's current conquest.  The innkeep slams
two flagons on the table between the drunkards.  "We're none of
us a fan of the king here, are we?  Let's all sit and drink to
his misfortune."

- **Tempt**: The brawlers had been arguing over a years-old
disagreement on owed dues.  Pennies, really; but enough for a
smoldering anger to persist.  Before the first blows fly, the
inkeep steps in, "That lost pay amounts to what, ten copper?
You both spend a copper for an ale here every week.  If you
promise to drop this score once and for all, I'll give you both
free ale to match the losses."

### Obstacle Course

Scene: Your character stares down a thin wooden path, thirty feet
long and suspended ten feet in the air, enforced on all sides by
whirling logs, lashing chains, and swinging leather bags.  A
heavy sack of gold sits waiting for them at the end.

- **Force**: Your mentor hit harder than any spinning log.  You
don't even bother to duck or cover.  Brushing aside the bags and
chains, the spinning logs groan to a halt under your grip.

- **Maneuver**: The most direct approach may not be the most
simple, but it is the most effective: just don't get hit.

- **Tempt**: As you step up to the course the spinning and
tumbling pieces ease down to an idle sway.  You flash a smile
at the man driving the mules below: five coin well spent.

- **Intuit**: You study the machine from afar, watching one
contestant after another tumble from the platform.  It takes an
hour to memorize the cycles, but once you're able to predict
where and how each contestant will fail, you're ready to take
on the machine yourself.
