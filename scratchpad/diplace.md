## Displace

When you try to reposition something or someone that would resist your influence (push it back, pull them close, lead them away, change an opinion, etc), answer the following questions and then roll it.

Who or what are you moving, and where? Can you move them there? (If not, do not roll.) Are you going to get into a bad position in the process?

On a hit, you get them where you want them to go.
On 1, the MC chooses one:
- You get put in danger.
- You're locked into the engagement, unable to break away without giving up your hold on their position.
- 

0: The MC makes a move; prepare for the worst.
