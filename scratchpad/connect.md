When you lay someone bare, roll. On any hit, you reveal something to them,
about them. On a 10+ hit, choose 2. On a 7–9 hit, choose 1.
• You reveal to them their secret heart.
• You reveal to them the hearts and natures of those nearest to them.
• You reveal to them their best way forward.
• You reveal to them their lost past.
Whichever you choose, you don’t know what they learn, but ask them how
they react to the revelation. However, if you have a glass, a basin, or an oracle
to read, you can catch a shadow or a mirror image of their revelation. Ask
them what you see.
On a miss, choose 1 anyway, but in the act, you lay yourself bare as well. The
MC chooses 1 against you, and asks you how you react in turn.
