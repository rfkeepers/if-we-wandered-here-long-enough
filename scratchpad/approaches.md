# approaches

Instead of stats the player must define the approaches used by their character.  Each playbook will have a set of approaches that are available to themselves, with part of "multiclassing" being the ability to take an approach provided by another playbook.

Each approach is a short phrase (4 to 7 words, ideally), that depicts the approach a character is adept at taking. This way we can divorce the in-fiction truth about what attributes a character possesses (strength, intelligence, charisma) and provide evocative statements about how the character brings those things to bear in the fiction.

Approaches have no scaling.  Every approach is a statement unto itself, and only provides itself as a benefit.  IE: every approach is only ever a +1.  There is no +N approach (n > 1), unless that turns out to be a fun thing to do in playbook moves.

Since no scaling exists, the point of gaining new approaches is to make the character more flexible in more situations. At some maximum this might end up in higher level players "floating" on an omnipresent benefit, having an approach available for every situation.  This is a non-issue for two reasons: 1) good on them for achieving that spread, so long as it's not handed to them by the game writing in a set of approaches that are more "powerfully" generic than others. 2) They still have to take action that fits their approach,
which means the fiction follows.

## approach guidelines

A well designed approach will pair a moderately broad concept with a thematic evocation of some theme.

For example, the fighter is all about, well, fighting.  So their approaches should center around solving problems with violence, physicality, and engaging danger head on. Some examples:

- Strike intending to maim, disable, or kill.
- Take a beating with a smile.
- Grapple them into submission.

Getting the approach just right is a tightrope walk. It's easy to land on statements that are too broadly applicable:

- Solve a problem with violence.
- Deflect a blow.
- Hold onto them.

And just as easy to make the approach too specific to be useful in many situations:

- Strike them down with your legendary weapon.
- Use your shield to parry a blow.
- Hold their arms in place.

Most dangerous of all are the statements that sound like approaches, but are actually the thing the character is doing in the fiction, not the approach they've taken to enact that in the fiction.

- Go for their weak spot.
- Take a blow by parrying it aside.
- Wrestle them away from their weapon.
