> Developer Note: This is currently words for their own sake. Not that I haven't made a sincere attempt to say the right things in the right way. I really have tried to get it right. More like, I don't quite know what "right" means for these agendas yet.  Not completely.

## This game wants to explore

This isn't a game for every story. It wants to tell stories with a certain kind of tone and atmosphere.  You won't break the game if you drift away from it, but you may end up fighting with it.

### Ecosystems that mesh and erupt

The world is larger than the characters. At any given moment there are creatures rustling in the brush, monsters squabbling over territory, deals getting struck over drinks, and people wandering in search of new homes. In some places and times these systems all settle into a rhythm and harmonize. But they can also collide with each other- setting fire to their homes, spilling out across boundaries, crashing into anyone who comes near.

You all live as part of this world.  Influencers as much as you are influenced.  The world moves, and you move with it.

### Vibrant characters moving the world

The characters in this world (especially the players' characters) are all curious and extraordinary people. When we see them in the spotlight we should see how sharply the stand out against the background and how they help other characters to do the same.

Most importantly of all, none of these characters are stationary. Each one has an ambition, a motivation, a dream.  They're all in motion and pushing the world toward what they want.  Not satisfied with simply wanting, they are always in the process of getting.  Or, at least, attempting. The world thus changes to their whims and efforts.

### Giving doom the middle finger

A terrible doom peeks over the horizon.  Something comes for the dungeon.  An end?  Or perhaps a new beginning.  The powers outside, pushing in?  The secrets beneath, seeping out?  The turmoil throughout, boiling over?

Your story, this game, is about how players overcome that Doom. Whatever tragedy, sacrifice and reshaping of the land is necessary, you will persevere.  The question is how you do it, how the dungeon transforms throughout, and where you find yourself by the end.

## Player Agendas

These agendas are for the Players.  You all form the engine that pushes this game forward and maintains its momentum.  It's up to you to bring scenes to life, to keep the game rolling, and to engage in conversation and fiction-building with enthusiasm, excitement, and delight.

The MC takes a big part in all this as well, but their goal is different.  They're here to keep you on your toes, to give you interesting situations and people to explore, and to enforce the truths of the world.  IE: their job is to give you a stage and a spotlight, your job is to stand on the stage and give a performance.

### Be bold, take risks, and embrace danger

Players should chase their goals with everything they've got. Use up your resources, call upon your allies, burden yourself with complications and conflicts. Whatever you do, don't stand still.

This is not a good game for tactics. For trying to make it to the end unscathed. It is a game about moving forward, through the thick and thin of it. You will get hurt and lose stuff and discover new loves and more.  You will change the world in your wake.

Don't overthink it.  There's no such thing as perfect play, and you won't avoid trouble by striving for it.  Act on your instincts.  Take that wild idea that pops into your head and run with it. Throw caution to the wind.

### Focus on how you make it happen

This game plays best when you're living in the current moment; when you explore the space around your character, the physicality of the objects all around, and the shifting emotions of the people beside you. The more you talk about the things your characters touches, sees, feels, and imagines, the more you can bring all the other players into this space, this moment.

Obstacles aren't overcome through intent.  You have to do it.  You have to pick things up and swing them, say the words and mean them, brace for impact and tell us all how the blow shakes you. Overcoming is the result of doing.

### Grapple with humanity, and grow with your character

Playbooks in this game are fantastic, exaggerated cutouts of common shapes from fantasy literature.  Caricatures more than characters.  You, player, are tasked with finding the human that inhabits them.  The game will help stay on this vector as much as it can, but in the end it has committed to the faith that you are here to explore _who_ your character is as much as what they can do. 

As with any great fiction, every character in this story has to learn and grow.  Whether they're that's a process of turning into a hero, growing into a mentor and guide for others, challenging their jaded past with new delights, or simply learning to accept themselves.  This is you, too. You have to find out.

Let this game compel your curiosity. What is it that your character lacks, or has, or loves, or resents, that prevents them from embracing their life as it is?  Who do they need to become?  And whose help do they need to get there?

### Play to tell a story, together

You have all come together, to this game, at your table, to play to find out what happens. That makes you creators as much as players.  You are carpenters who erect set pieces, playwrights who script the lines, actors who perform the scene and audience to revel in it.  This is your chance to embrace all of it.

Doing this together means sharing in the responsibilities.  Take your spot in the spotlight!  And shine it on your fellow players, too.  Write your interesting ideas into the fiction!  And ask the writers room for guidance and ideas, too.  Set the scenes you want to lead!  And take a supporting role when others get theirs.

## MC Agendas

These agendas are for the Master of Ceremonies.  You are the truth of the world, the sword of doom dangling overhead, the caltrops underfoot and the bubbling, refreshing spring.  It's up to you to provide the players with opportunities to show off, to explore their feelings, and to change the world.

The players take a big part in all of that as well, but their goal is different.  They're here to dazzle the spotlight, to seed the world with their enthusiasm, and to clamber over obstacles. IE: their job is to go on an adventure, your job is to make the adventure thrilling.

### Portray a living, moving, wanting world

The dungeon is a collage of ecosystems, biomes, cities, peoples, and creatures. All the denizens of it hustle and explore and tunnel and conquer like the scurrying little organisms they truly are. The things that wait silent are predators. The ones that migrate are raiders or the raided. All the rest thrive within their natural environment.  Your players keep wandering through the middle of the mess.

The wonder of this world isn't bound to its spectacle. You should introduce spectacle, certainly.  But you should more often take time to indulge in the small, often quiet and overlooked industries of creatures and people making the best of their lives in this space.  There is no barren space in the dungeon.  Everywhere, it is flush with life.

### Make space for the players to explore

It doesn't matter what the players are exploring- the dungeon, the food, the plot hooks, each other, themselves- as long as they're compelled to search and find new details. Players should be excited to make discoveries and chase down loose ends.

Give them room to breathe between the action. Make space to ask questions and ponder on the answers. Dangle little teases that could captivate their interest. Indulge them when they go looking for answers.

### Spotlight how the characters overcome obstacles

This game plays best when the players have clear understanding of where they are, what's happening around them, and what tools are at arms length. The more you talk about the things the players can touch, see, feel, and imagine, the more capably they will reach out to grasp those things and put them to use.

Obstacles should be things the characters can overcome through interaction.  Things that they can take swings at, defenses they can pry and cleave apart, people they can sing to and console. Getting past an obstacle never needs to happen a certain way. So long as the table can see the action and feel the impacts.

Your goal is to guide them towards those interactions. To get them to swing at, pry apart, and sing to the things in the world. When they stray, or get addled, ask them plainly: what are you trying to do, and how do you do it?

### Play to find out what it takes to prevail over doom

Two things are always inevitable in this game.  First, the Doom will arrive.  Second, the players will triumph at the end of it all. The question is not if it happens. The question, is at what cost?

As play progresses and the existential threat of doom begins to press in at all corners of play, remind the players what they have, what might get lost, and what could be saved. Not merely each other: all the world of the dungeon and the surface.  Everything and everyone they've met and made connections to.  It's all at stake.
