##### About the name of the game.

As a final note- because I can't resist sharing the things I love- the name of the game is a line from `The Dream of the Consortium` by Steven Millhauser, from his collection, _The Knife Thrower and Other Stories_.

> If we wandered here long enough, we would find departments so audacious that to imagine them clearly would be to suffer harm, as from the blow of a hammer. With such visions and premonitions swirling within, we pressed to the utmost ends of the store, searching out unseen corners, feverishly ascending and descending a series of zigzag escalators, passing through departments we had seen so quickly that they already looked unfamiliar.

In a thick darkness lit here and there by greenish lights, tunnels braced with heavy posts stretched in every direction.  Workers wearing helmets with lights in them raised their glistening arms to swing pickaxes against rockfaces.  Even in this raw region of barely imagined departments, men in neat suits were measuring distances with metallic tape measures, marking the ground with chalk.  A freestanding door lay against a rocky wall beside an opening, and a man in a necktie ushered us inside.

Women of intolerable beauty turned their faces toward us slowly, with sad smiles; we had the sensation of having entered some dark and melancholy dream. Only gradually did we realize that the figures were on display.  The art of mobile holography, a salesman was saying, was on the verge of another breakthrough---these images, under carefully controlled conditions, were able to stimulate in the spectator a sensation of touch and to give the illusion of life itself.  Slowly a demon-eyed woman glided toward us; as she came closer we felt, in our fingertips, a faint tingle or tickle.  She continued to smile vaguely at us as we snatched our hands away.
