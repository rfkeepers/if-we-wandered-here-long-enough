# What Here is Different?

Aka: what does it feel like to play this game, and how is that different from other similar games?

First off, what here is the same?  Or basically the same?

From a birds-eye view this game is Powered by the Apocalypse, through and through.  It's got the moves and the playbooks and the play should gracefully collapse inward to the conversation and so on.  All of that is here. All the differences below are working within that space, not against or outside of it.

Superficial changes may initially out.  Approaches instead of stats.  Slightly different dice rolling (closer to, but not exactly, BitD style). A robust system for representing "things" called Resources, and more. These systems add a bit of unique texture, but they don't really change the way it feels to play the game, compared to norms and expectations.

Closer inspection still, the general experience of play, the conversation is still a cycle of the MC making a move, asking what the players what they do, then working with the answers. We most certainly still play to find out what happens.

Okay, so it's a PbtA.  Got it.  Then what here is different?

## Conversation First and Softening Blows

This game wants you to use the conversation in times where other games would turn toward moves.

Let's think about some combat. It tends to make for simple examples.

#### The Scorpion, pt 1

You, the fighter, are cornered by a giant scorpion.  What do you do?  You attack it?  Alright, you attack it.  Your sword clatters against one claw.  The other claw smashes into your arm: take the pain, "bruised".  It chitters at you, curling its tail, ready to strike.  What do you do?  You grapple its claws?  Okay, you're strong, you can do that; you grab both of its claws underneath your arm.  Its tail whips forward, spearing you in the chest.  Take the wound, "stabbed".

And so on, trading blows, back and forth. Why doesn't this seem to be going anywhere?

This example, I admit, is a straw-man. Our "player" isn't engaging with all the mechanics (more on defeating that scorpion down below).  They're taking action with little to no sense of tactics, so the MC responds punitively.  That's me, the author, setting up the discussion.  Try not to read this one as a good depiction of play.

#### Conversation Follows Fiction

Straw-man or not, the above example helps highlight two important patterns.  The first is that your character does what you say, and the MC has to hold a hard line about whether it has any effect.

"I attack them with my sword," can work in some situations.  A giant scorpion is not one of those situations.

At the same time, "I take hold of the beast's claws," did succeed. The fighter is strong, and experienced at grappling (or so we could assume).  We don't need a roll to check on that fiction.  It just happens.  The scorpion still retaliated, further hurting the fighter, but doesn't that make sense for the position they're in?

The second of the patterns is that most of the outcomes, when in risky and dangerous settings, should feel like rolling a mixed success.  You say what you do, then the MC tells you the cost or complication.

#### Softening Blows

Without moves, players have little capacity to avoid consequences.  How do we avoid that?  By shifting the Harm to other places. There are a handful of mechanics available to the player which can defer Harm. In a sense, we're replacing rolling with attrition (more on attrition recovery in the last section).

Let's revisit the Harm taken in that example.

The MC says, "take the pain, bruised."  The fighter has an easy counter for that one.  "I'm going to mark off my armor and let it absorb the blow".

Later, "Its tail whips forward, spearing you in the chest.  Take the wound, 'stabbed'."  Our fighter already expended their armor.  This time, they opt to take a condition instead.  "The stinger just barely misses my cheek, I can feel its tail brushing against my ear.  That could have killed me!  Now that thought keeps racing through my head.  I'm going to take the condition, 'Distracted'."

Now we're in a much different situation.  Our fighter is unharmed, and they've got the beast by its claws.

## NPC Resources as Obstacles

NPCs have a unique way of representing their stats and status.  They're combined into a system named resources.  (Side note, PCs get Resources of their own, but those are different).  Here's what our Scorpion looks like.

```
Giant Scorpion
---
Drive: Avoid attention. Protect its hunting spot.

Resources:
- Lightning-quick strikes from its venemous tail.
- Great claws that grasp their prey and never let go.
```

This nasty critter has two resources: its tail and its claws.  We saw both of those in play already.  Those aren't the _only_ parts of its body that it's allowed to use. But since they're listed as resources, the players need to deal with those obstacles in specific.

Focusing in resources is the other side of pushing conversations first.  Moves haven't been removed from the game.  Instead, they're tailored to make the interaction with resources visible.

If we glance over at the [common action moves](moves/core/actions.md), it looks like **Separate** could help us deal with the tail.

#### The Scorpion, pt 2

Our fighter is busy holding the scorpion's claws, let's add a new character.  How about a Rogue?

Alright rogue, what do you do?  Pull out your sword and chop off its tail?  Bad news: no matter what angle you approach from, its tail lashes out at you.  If you want to cut it off you'll have to get stabbed; do you want to follow through?  No?  That's fine.  A rope, you say?  Lasso the tail and tie it down?  Okay, first **Produce a Resource** to get your rope.  Then we can roll **Separate**.  A 1? Oof.  You do it, but it tears apart your cloak as you wrestle the tail in place.

That's a more appropriate example. The two characters are acting in concert. Each one has their eye on one of the scorpion's resources. The Rogue attempts one strategy, reconsiders the consequences, and tries a different approach instead.  And, of course, this time we rolled to see how it worked.

#### Bringing details to the forefront

An important element to spotlight in these examples is that neither player abstracted the fiction with a roll. Every action they took, resource they utilized, and tactic they attempted was shown in detail.

That's the intended point of view; up close, where we the audience can see all the movements, and the players can work with the fiction directly.

## The importance of resting

All this hubbub about managing play through the conversation and using attrition to smooth out the punishments. How does the other side of the page read?  What do we do in response to that play?

The characters should have taken some Harm by now, or perhaps had their Resources damaged.  They need some time to recover as well.  Time to take a rest.

Resting, in this game, is a lot like a downtime phase.  Each character picks one thing they'd like to spend their time on.  In all likelihood they'll want to patch up themselves and their allies.  Since they only get to take one action per rest, they might have to make a trade-off and carry on with some lingering issues.

Rest is also, of course, a time to get the players talking.  None of the rest moves allow a players to merely patch up a problem.  That happens in the background.  In the foreground the characters are chatting, telling stories about themselves and others, thinking about their past, and considering what to do next.
