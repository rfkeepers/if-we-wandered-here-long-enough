# The Setting

At the beginning there was the city, up on the surface of the world, warm with sun and salt-scoured by the tidal storms that blew in from its harbors.  It stayed like that for a good long while.

The entrance to the dungeon was discovered in the basement of old Crodwell's house, so they say. He'd filed a request for aid, that the city should help him patch the breezy, at times shrieking, hole in his basement wall.

Old news now.  Crodwell died and his kids had already left long before that.  The city itself sucks down into the great hole he left behind, as if all the architecture- the white stone and glazed red clay tiles- were draining into it. There's an archway where his house used to be; black granite pillers crowned with two watchful gargoyles, teeth snarling and tongues lolling at the crowds parading up and down the great, descending stairway. These people don't know who Crodwell was, or how he reached his weathered arm into the folds between worlds and started to pull at the stitchings. They only know the Dungeon itself.

Sixty three years on, the generations that grew up in this town see the Dungeon the way others see a neighborhood. They bicker about where among the towering forests of the second floor one can find the best mushrooms for soups, or whether the harvest market is better at the cavernous first floor or the fifth's abandoned ampitheater. Young workers living in the fourth floor camps toil at the hatcheries, then steal away to fill their pipes in the dewey haze atop the third floor's labyrinth.  New lovers lose their weekends picnicing in the electric dunes beneath the first floor's tidepools.

Yet the depths go deeper and deeper still. Stay away, they say, from the chiming tunnels at the end of the seventh floor. Carry stones ready to throw at the leathery old toads who sometimes wander upwards from their mires in the eighth. And if you meet a pale traveler claiming to live in the lands below, you run, and don't look back.

## Where this all takes place

This game centers around a single city and the sprawling dungeon beneath.  The dungeon itself is old news. People found that generations ago. Seventy years, maybe an entire century?  It wasn't always here, but it isn't new to anyone, either.

Since that time the people have done what people always do with accessible resources: build a society around their extraction and integrate the space into their own way of life.  At least, the easy parts of it.  Even now, few have ventured beyond the tamed territory.  Like the mountains beyond the foothills or ocean depths beyond the coast, the dungeon depths holdy strange and wild unknowns.

This is where you all come along: unsatisfied with the little you can percieve and looking for more.

## Your very own dungeon

As part of starting up the game, along with creating characters and building a personal history, you're going to build out the city and some parts of the dungeon beneath it.

Creating the dungeon isn't only about writing down a list of places. You'll also begin seeding the ecology within it as well.  Ecology, in this game, is a lot like a faction system, with independant groups that all move and act on their own.

Not only do the players help generate the concepts for these groups, they'll also continually engage by moving these groups around the dungeon and making moves on their behalf: starting and settling disputes, moving or blocking space.

## The encroaching Doom

Later in play, another dimension appears: the Doom. An end is approaching, and it seeks to take the dungeon with you all. Your table also designs its Doom. Unlike ecology, the MC is in charge of the Doom.  After it gets introduced, all that's left is to tick down the hours until it arrives...

## A note on colonialism vs urban sprawl

This game was not designed to explore any manner of colonialism. In my imagination of this place and what stories could spring from it, I have imposed a measure of avoidance around thinking of the dungeon, in its nacent form, as something that the city "colonized".  Personally, I'm more interested in how urbanization and urban sprawl interacts and conflicts with wilderness and wilderness preservation. That's where _my_ brain gets hooked.

Yet still, I can see where this setting has the trappings of colonialism.  How only a few key details could shift the perspective entirely. If you're interested in telling that kind of story by using this game, I'm honored that you feel it'd be up that task. I also, unfortunately, lack both the perspective and the capability necessary to guide your play in a way that properly respects and understands the history and impacts on colonialized peoples and spaces.
