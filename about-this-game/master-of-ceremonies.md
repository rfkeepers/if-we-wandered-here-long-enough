# Master of Ceremonies

> Designer note: I am having a hard debate on whether this role should be called the `Lunatic Magician`, in reference to _Delicious in Dungeons_.

> Designer note: Each of these should get a blurb later on.

## Principles

- Make the dungeon worth discovering.
- Hit them hard, then let them recover.
- Set characters on paths that collide with each other.
- Connect people to their environment.
- Ask questions and loose the answers somewhere in the world.
- When traveling, keep trouble and consequence nipping at their heels.
- When resting, give them room to breathe easy.
- Make your Doom inescapable, unstoppable, and threatening.
- Give every character a name, a heart, and a problem.
