# The Experiment

This is, more or less, a blog post.  I don't write blogs.  Don't even have have a place to post one if I did.  Instead it's all in here with the game.

The tone used in this writing is, well, authoritative, might be the word? I forced myself to not add words hemming and hawing over the ideas, to help make reading it easier. Therefore, up here at the top, I want to clarify that I _do_ hem and haw over this stuff. All the time.

No matter how convinced I may sound below, I can assure you that I don't think of these convictions as bulletproof, and I welcome any position and argument that I could be wrong.

## Experiment 1 - Risk and Uncertainty

I have a frustrating relationship with the move **Defy Danger** from Dungeon World 1.  It's not a bad move. It's well written, concise, and- especially if the GM is experienced with using their moves- can handle nearly any risk with relative elegance.  Hell, you can [build whole games](https://johnharper.itch.io/world-of-dungeons) around [the concept](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2020/02/defying-danger-rpg.html).

Also, I hate it.

### Rolling for negative space

The set of moves in a PbtA- the core moves, especially- establish three critical concepts.  1/ What is the atmosphere? (tone, word choice, description, area of focus, etc) 2/ What must happen a certain way? (when do we turn to the mechanics) 3/ What gets acknowledged, but not focused?

That third point is what I'm calling Negative Space. The first two points are the things that the game wants you to be thinking about, talking about, and doing. They provide signal and action.  The third point is the rest.  Not stuff to _avoid_, necessarily.  Just stuff we let fall into the void, back to the background, under the rug.

The relationship between these tenets is what creates contrast; brightening certain parts of play and dulling other spaces.  It guides our attention towards the most fruitful places.y

Then comes along **Defy Danger**; negative space weaponized in a move.  The distance between any two moves is always filled by the opportunity to defy danger.  The game has issued a blanket statement: every action you take is important and worthy of attention.

### Jumping the gap

One of the oft-stated principles of PbtA (probably many systems of ttrps) is, `"if there's no risk or uncertainty, don't roll"`. Tidy little sentiment, that one. It teaches GMs and players alike the fundamental interaction between the conversation and the mechanics.

The inverse doesn't hold up as well, `"if any risk or uncertainty exists, roll"`.  This leads to my new favorite example: there's a gap in the road ahead.  The characters have to jump over it.  Leaping across is risky and we aren't sure they'll make it.  So... I guess we have to roll something?

Does your game have a negative space move? Good job, everyone roll it and see.  Maybe it has something like **Act as a Group**? Okay, do that, see what the damage is. Don't worry about the horses and the big cart, we can wrap that into how we explain the roll, no problem.  Now everyone dusts off their pants and gives congratulations and we can go back to traveling down the road.

Question: why was there a gap in the road?  No, really, I want to know why it was there.

I doubt you're playing the PbtA of Oregon Trail (though if you are, neat!). My guess is this: your GM is looking at their agendas ("fill the world with perilous adventure") and their moves ("show off their strengths and weaknesses") and the basic moves ("Overcome Uncertain Risk") and all that fits, so they draw a gap in the road and announce, "we're going to play to find out what happens!"

### What gaps do you make your players leap?

The problem with this kind of play is that the table isn't really "playing to find out what happens".  The GM decided to "introduce arbitrary risk to force a roll and see if the result takes us all on an unexpected adventure."  A situation contrived out of pulling a loose thread from the side of one of the moves, weaving it through the principles for support, and needling it into the conversation.

The gap is, of course, an allegory.  You, GM of an arbitrary game, might be making your players jump more gaps on their road than you realize. Random battles are a gap. Resource thievery is a gap. A mundane lock on a door is gap. The reinforcement mech with a railgun and shield the color of rippling opals which requires two resonant bards to harmonize to shatter, that's a gap.

Gaps are not inherently problematic. If I continue too far down this "everything is gap" explanation I'm going to give the impression that I really think they're trouble. A gap is an obstacle, and every game needs to put obstacles in front of its characters. For every one of those examples there are five beautifully designed games all about jumping that kind of gap.

The trouble all arises from that activity of stringing backwards from mechanic to fiction. True, the problem is just as often poor GMing as much as system design. But we can help fix GMs. Systems are a tad more difficult.

### Not rolling for negative space

Alright, I'll stop waxing theoretical about other games.  What am I trying to do about it in this game?

First, let's revisit a previous idea: `"if there's no risk or uncertainty, don't roll"`.  Throw that one out the window.  Replace it with, `"roll when a move tells you to roll, regardless of your position in the fiction"`.  Does that make a game better?

Well, no, not really.  Not on its own.  It really depends on the moves that surround it.  Put that up next to **Defy Danger** and all play becomes a nuisance (who decides what's uncertain or dangerous, anyway?).

Second try: what if we lean into that negative space?  Like, really use it to support the weight of the play. Make it the primary mode of play.  All conversation, all the time.  A player says something, then the GM makes a move, then the player says something else.  Does that make the game better?

Well, no, not really.  Not on it's own. The game loses variety that way.  We probably do a lot of playing to find out what happens.  And if there's a gap to jump, the players jump over it pretty quick. But it also risks a lot of back and forth about what's possible in the first place.  The nice thing about moves is that you can trigger them, and no one gets to say you didn't.

Okay, once more: is there a _middle ground_ here?  Somewhere that leans more heavily on conversation and negative space, but has a set of moves to fall back on?

That's what I've aimed for.  Is it a succesful take?  Honestly, I don't know. At this stage I'm just crossing my fingers.  And- forgive me this pun- I'll have to play to find out. fw
