# Traveler

## Approaches

Each feature in this playbook starts with two unique approaches.  See the Feature for more.

## Core

### Feature

#### Not of this Land

Many adventurers can claim themselves well-traveled.  Having seen both the east and the west, walked mountains and sailed seas, tasted spiced fruits and smoked meats.  Yet, if asked, they claim this as a thing they do, not the person they are.  All they do is see and walk and taste these places.  They do not _live_ them.

You are not the same.  You have lived where others have visited.  Adopted- and abandoned- homes, nations, cultures.  And here you are now, caught up in all of this trying to make the best of it.

Pick one of the following during character creation, and only one.  Keep in mind that the decision is final: this is fundamentally who you are, regardless of who you'll become.  You gain the two approaches listed for that feature, the **Limit Break**, and any listed moves.


---

##### Bard

The widely and enthusiastically traveled poet.  Broadly knowledgable in all affairs of intrigue and politics.  You have friends, enemies, and rivals across the land all in equal measure.  All applaud your arrival, and none bar your departure.

Approaches:
- Steal their attention.
- Delight or advise with story and song.


###### Elicit Feeling

When you perform for an audience with the intent to get them to feel a specific emotion, tell the MC what emotion you're aiming for, describe your performance, and roll it.

2+: You get exactly the reaction you want.  If you want any NPCs to feel particularly moved, tell the MC who they are.
1: Pick one, the effect...
- is short-lived.
- goes too far.
- gets an additional and unwanted result.
0: Prepare for the worst.


###### Hobnobber

No one can hide a party from you. When you suspect there's a gathering happening that you weren't invited to, ask the MC about it. They must tell you honestly if you're missing out or not, but they don't have to tell you what you're missing out on.

When you try to convince someone to get you (and maybe your friends) into an event, roll it.  They'll be able to get you in, no matter the outcome of the roll.

2+: it's not a problem at all.
1: it requires going into their debt or dealing with some serious constraints.
0: you're in, but the mood is bad. It's obvious you aren't supposed to be here. 


###### Limit Break

Your frustrations set roots deep in your mind.  Deeper, perhaps, than you might even notice.Write down your current Conditions on a separate notecard before you erase them.

The next time you **Elicit Feelings**, before you roll, read those Conditions back to the MC.  They'll pick one from the list and tell you what it is.  This condition infects your performance, seeping between all the lines and notes.  Whatever emotion you cause them to feel, they feel this in equal measure.

##### Conquerer

Monarch, away from your throne, here to establish a territory for yourself.  Are you reclaiming a lost seat of power, or do you seek to build one anew?

Approaches:
- Bear your title, heritage, or claims.
- Command those who should follow.

###### Elite Retainers

You have one or two highly skilled persons at your side.  Fill out the details below for each of them.  

Name, pronouns, look, and relationship (retainer, guard, concubine, spouse, child, etc).

Pick two specialties for each character:
- Advice & Empathy
- Crafting (say which)
- Combat
- Cooking & Supply Management
- Doctoring & Medicine
- Obscure Knowledge
- Politics & Socializing
- Rituals
- Thievery

And pick one flaw:
- Disobedient
- Easily Seduced
- Free Spirited
- Ill Tempered
- Impulsive
- Jealous
- Reckless
- Sickly
- Untrustworthy
- Physically Weak

These characters are NPCs, and thus ostensibly under the MC's control, but the two of you should work together to find out who they are, how they behave, and what they want.


###### Always Ready at Hand

You may say at any time that one of your retainers enters the scene.  If it is even remotely possible (the MC has the final say), the appear exactly at that moment, and exactly as you describe.


###### Limit Break

One of your retainers, unable to bear to see your suffering, snaps.  Either their flaw gets the best of them in a big way, or they take it upon themselves to get some revenge.  The MC will tell you how they've taken it upon themselves to correct or rebalance the situation.

---

##### Ranger

Some travel between nations; you abandoned nations altogether.  Walker of all paths; drinker of every spring; hunter, protector, and friend to all beasts and birds.  No other knows every corner of the wild world as you do.

Approaches:
- Use the wilds for your survival.
- Place or spring a trap.

###### Compel Beast

Speaking with chitters and squeals comes as naturally to you as any human language.  You can communicate with all manner of animal and monster.

When you issue a command, plea, or request to a beast, roll it.  On a hit, they do it.  On 1: they demand payment upfront, or a debt for later. 0: you've angered or upset them. The MC makes a move.

###### Stalk

When you hunt prey through an extended chase, answer the following questions and hold one _Hunt_ for each yes.

- Do I know my way around this place already?
- Is my prey easily followed: do they stand out or leave obvious tracks?
- Am I free to follow them without interference?

For as long as you stalk your prey you can spend _Hunt_ 1:1 on the following options.  After you spend one, the MC makes a move.  When you abandon your hunt, or if they turn and confront you, lose all remaining _Hunt_.

- Deal Harm.
- Damage their resources.
- Direct them toward a certain path.
- Separate them from their allies.
- Slow or hasten their movement.
- Learn something about them.


###### Limit Break

If it wasn't for this situation you're in, surrounded by these people, you could be where you really want to be right now: alone somewhere, out among the wilds.  That might even be exactly what you need right now.

Get out of the scene as quickly as possible.  If anyone tries to keep you here, you lash out at them.  If they persist, do whatever it takes to get them out of your way.

Don't join back up with your friends right away.  Take a scene to yourself first.  At some point during that scene, **Dig Up a Secret** as if you rolled 2+.

---

##### Outlaw

Having a name and reputation comes in handy, if you know how to wield 'em right.  Most trouble'll back off when you let 'em know who you are. The fools may not; but you've never let a fool stand in your way. That'd tarnish the reputation. Best, though, is that most times folk don't even care to ask.  And that's just what you need.

Approaches:
- Cause a bit of mayhem.
- Spin seductive yarns of your exploits.


###### Something Wrong, Officer?

When you dissuade a person of law or authority from getting involved, roll it. 2+: They give you the benefit of the doubt and leave you alone. 1: They're hesitant and will keep an eye on things- maybe even follow you around a bit to make sure- but they won't jump in until someone gives them a reason. 


###### For Safe Keeping

Caches: 〚 〛-〚 〛-〚 〛-〚 〛

You have four caches hidden throughout the world. Old gains for a rainy day. When you go unearth one of your caches, check off one box and tell the MC what you had hidden inside.


###### Limit Break

Safety: 4

An old acquaintance (or one of their lackeys) appears in the scene.

If you haven't introduced them before, do so now: who are they? What do they look like? Are they trying to bring you in? Looking to call in old debts? Coming for revenge? Say what your history is, and why they're on your tail.

Reduce your Safety by 1 and roll with Safety.  2+: either they just want to talk, or they weren't prepared to find you. 1: They're here for you, and will take you if they can.  0: This is their last chance, and they've brought everything in their arsenal to bear: weapons, magic, lackeys, law... the works.

If you settle the score with that old acquaintance for good, reset your Safety to 4.  Next time you use this move, come up with a new old acquaintance.  Person like you has no shortage of past run-ins.

##### Stranger from a Strange Land

"You aren't from around here," doesn't cut it.  No one knows where you're from.  Or how you got here. Sailed across the uncrossed sea?  Slipped through the grove that grows between planes? Discarded upon a doorstep by the fae?  This isn't your world.  You aren't supposed to be here.

Approaches:
- Eschew a convention of the civilized world.
- Feign or harness innocence and ignorance.

###### Unknowable Knowledge

When you first gain this move, choose an area of outlandish knowledge and understanding:

- the body (healing, surgery, illness)
- demonology (summoning, contracts, curses)
- the dead (communing with, hauntings, appeasement)
- premonition (prediction, knowledge of future events)
- the divine (its presence and usage, or phenomena involving it)
- _____________ (other)

When you leverage this knowledge to heal or Harm, to fabricate or modify or destroy a thing, or to otherwise cause some specific effect, ask the MC what it requires. They will select one or more from the list below. If you meet or agree to those requirements, you do it.

- Doing so will put you and/or others in danger of _____________.
- The result will be unreliable or have constraining limitations.
- The thing you want is not possible, but you could produce a close approximation like _____________.
- It'll be short-lived or just short of meeting your needs in some other way.


###### Limit Break

For the briefest moment, before you can catch yourself, you do a behavior that is at once entirely natural to you and terribly unnatural to everyone around you.  What is it?  Ask who saw you do it (at least one character has to say yes).  Have them tell you why it makes them feel repulsed, terrified, or embarrassed. 


---

##### Expatriate Shopkeeper

Home- your true home- is a place long gone for you. Perhaps not for the world, it may still exist.  But, whatever the reason, it's no longer a place for you.  You're elsewhere now, holding down a strange little shop that captures the locals' adoration and consternation in equal measure.  It's a living.  And you're very good at living.

Approaches:
- Offer safety, leisure, or secrecy through your shop.
- Give a taste that leaves them wanting more.


###### It's A Living

You have your own little shop. It might not be much (or maybe it is?) but it's yours.  What do you sell?  Who is your clientele? Pick two benefits when you create your character:

- Big enough for a group of people to safely rest and sleep.
- Stocked with oddities and rarities.
- Respected and loved by the community.
- Reliable staff to run the place.
- Someone always has interesting news and rumors for you.
- You've greased enough palms to make it easy to fence illicit goods.

At the beginning of every session, roll 2 dice.  2+: Business is good, take 1 Wealth.  1: You break even.  0: Business is hurting, lose 1 Wealth.  If you can't pay up, expect a visit from a debt collector.


###### I've Got What You Need

When you drop a hint about your ability to procure or secret illicit goods or services, roll it. On a Hit: Anyone with a reason to be interested in your offer will find a way to contact you. 2+: You get to choose if- and if so, which- rumors get spread connecting you to what you offered. 1: Rumors about your connection to contraband will spread whether you want them to or not.


###### Limit Break

Roll 1 die and match it to the table below.  The next time you go to your shop:

- 1: The local lawkeepers have come by for a visit; they've got a lead saying you're up to no good.
- 2: Someone ransacked the place.  How much damage did they do?  Did they leave any clues about why?
- 3: A thief has stolen something very important.  What is it?
- 4: Something unimportant was stolen.  Unimportant, but the thievery bothers you anyway.  What's on your mind?
- 5: Disaster strikes: fire, flood, gremlins, angry patrons, etc.  What happens?
- 6: Someone has come by to make you an offer that's too good to be true.  What are they offering, and why shouldn't you trust them?
