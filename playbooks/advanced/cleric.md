## Core Feature

### Divine Source

Your power is not your own.  You are a vessel for something or someone else: A deity, the venerable ancients, spirits of the land, hungering lord of all devils, or perhaps some wailing and limitless machine (hereafter, all are referred to as "your deity").  Whichever it may be, it uses you as it would a conduit- the channel through which it pours its influence into the world.

---

First, how did you come by your power?

- **Prelate** - Absolute devotion and worship to their name and word.
- **Contract** - A terrible sacrifice in trade for power.
- **Benefactor** - They're your patron; it's just business.
- **Chosen** - You had no say in the matter.

---

Second, pick the tenets of their domain.

#### Crafting

They want you to: Produce a work showcasing your mastery.
They hate it when you: Desecration of great works or places of work.
Their power provides: Creation, Knowledge

They allow you to: Pick one:
- Your bare hands can shape wood as if it were clay.
- Your bare hands are impervious to heat and flame.
- Your bare hands can hammer metal as if they were made of stone.

#### Order

They want you to: Enforce and protect the laws of man.
They hate it when you: Upset the balance of established power, or usurp authority.
Their power provides: Safety, Communication

They allow you to: Place a simple, restrictive command upon an inanimate object. No natural force in the world may break that command.  Ex: "no one can move you," or, "you cannot enter the palace," or, "you cannot be found by the Marquis".

#### The Hearth

They want you to: Go out of your way to offer help to the needy.
They hate it when you: Suffer someone in need to go without aid.  Exhaust efforts helping those who punish others.
Their power provides: Growth, Healing

They allow you to: Erase pain and mend wounds after merely an hour of ritual prayer (or some equivalent act of devotion).

#### War

They want you to: Bring a mighty opponent to their knees.
They hate it when you: Deescalate a conflict.
Their power provides: Purifying Flame, Disorder

They allow you to: Summon your deity's chosen weapon (say what it is, and what it looks like).

#### Purity

They want you to: Destroy something that has been contaminated.
They hate it when you: Tell a lie, spread rumors, or manipulate emotions.
Their power provides: Light, Purifying Flame

They allow you to: Extract poison, rot, mold, decay, or foulness.

#### Exploration

They want you to: Get utterly lost with someone else.
They hate it when you: Lead an unwitting person into danger or give false directions.
Their power provides: Communication, Knowledge

They allow you to: Connect the entrance of any tent you pitch to a large and well-stocked yurt or cabin.  Say what the interior looks like (you get taken to the same place, every time).

---

Finally, name your deity, and pick one of the following:
- They (or a minion of theirs) are always nearby.  What do they look like?  Can everyone see them, or just you?
- They have marked you as their own.  This mark is obvious, visible to everyone, and unable to be secreted.  (Tattoos, a halo, an aura, the sound of bells, the smell of creosote, etc) Describe it.
- You carry around a piece of their body.  Say what it is, and what it looks like.  Where do you keep it?  Are you secretive about having it, or do you flaunt it?
- You carry a contract stating the tenets of your connection.  Say what it looks like, and how you keep it safe. What would happen if someone else got their hands on it? What would happen if it were destroyed?

## Core Moves

###### Invoke the Divine

When you call upon your deity's power, say what you ask for, answer the following questions, then roll it.

- Does your deity have a seat of power here? (take advantage)
- Does an enemy of your deity have a seat of power here? (take disadvantage)

2+: The result goes too far.  You were a fool to think this was under your control.  Like ants, you are all swept up in the torrent.
1: You get what you wanted, and what happens afterwards is satisfactory to your goals.  That doesn't mean nothing else happened.  More always happens.  More than you asked for, more than you planned.  This time, at least, it might all work out.
0: You get what you wished for, in a technical or meaningless way.  It's not what you wanted.  Not really.

Regardless of the roll, divine authority is unleashed upon the world, mighty and terrible. Ask or tell the MC how this power Escalates the situation.

(description: This move cannot perform a meager task, such as to light your path or heal a wounded ally.  The power of the divine is a akin to the forces of nature. It crashes through cities and reshapes the land.  You, brave or stupid as you may be, have called that power onto the world.)

###### A Conduit For the Divine

- Divine: 〚 〛

Whenever you take an action directly aligned with your deity's desires (doing exactly what they want, doing something their enemy hates) or counter to them (doing something your deity hates, or giving their enemy what they want), the MC gains 1 Divine (you get to keep track of it for them on this sheet).

The MC may spend a Divine at any time to do the following:
- Empower or disempower you: take advantage or disadvantage on a roll.
- Lash out using their power: they'll tell you how your divine reaches out and affects the world.

###### Perform a Cantrip

When you exercise the power your deity has given you (that thing they allow you to do), you do it.  Your deity would never let you blunder such a simple use of their power.

###### Limit Break

Catastrophe: 〚 〛-〚 〛-〚 〛-〚 〛

Each time you use this move, add 1, then follow the matching section.  

(side note: need a diversion and reset).

1. Another Cleric arrives.  One of yours?  One of your enemies?  Something new altogether? Tell the MC who it is, what they believe, and why you've got a bad feeling about this.
2. Their influence grows.  Their schemes careen forward, spurred ahead with a momentum that resists any attempts to resist them.  Tell the MC what you know they've been up to.  The MC will tell you what they know they've been up to.
3. Catastrophe arrives.  Their deity?  Yours?  Does it matter?  All are punish'd.  Tell the MC what happened.  They'll tell you the aftermath.
4. You'll get one last confrontation with that Cleric before they disappear forever.  Work with the MC to set up a scene.  Afterwards, reset the clock to 0/4. (or change this move entirely?).
