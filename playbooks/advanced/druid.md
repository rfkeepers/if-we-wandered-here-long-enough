## Core

### Features

#### Child of the Wilds

You were raised in a crib of thistles, learned to walk while stepping over snakes, learned to swim braving torrents of rivers, you hunted and fed by tooth and nail.  You learned, eventually, to speak works instead of uttering growls, and to dance to instruments instead of moonlight. But the wilds are always inside of you, and the reek of a city never leaves your nose.

Pick the way that the wilds have changed you.

---

##### **Shape-Shifter**

Pick three creatures and write them down.  You may _Shapeshift_ into any of these forms.  When you advance this feature, add two more creatures to your list of forms.

Animal Forms:
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________

Also: Pick an animalistic tell (a physical attribute like: antlers, feathers, fur, etc) and incorporate it into your look. Your tell remains no matter what other changes happen to your body. The intensity of your tell increases or decreases along with your **Feral Instincts**.

###### **Shapeshift**

When you change your body into one of your animal forms, mark _wild_ and roll with feral instinct. On 2+: you change quickly and without issue. On 1: it takes additional time and effort, or you attract unwanted attention. On a 0: the MC makes a move.

Your new shape is limited to the animal you become. Your strengths and weaknesses, size, and communication is the same as that creature’s. So long as you’re not locked into your **Feral Instincts**, returning to your original form is always a quick and easy process.

###### **Chimera**

When you **Shapeshift** and push your form beyond it's natural limitations, mark an additional _wild_ to bend nature to your want.  You may do either or both of the following:
- Grow as large or as small as you want.
- Combine the forms of multiple creatures into a single body: an unnatural and mythic beast.

In addition to handling the **Shapeshift** roll as stated, also:
On a Miss, pick one:
- This unnatural form of yours terrifies or provokes onlookers.
- (???) Some aberration occurs, the transformation is complicated in some way.
- Nature pushes back, attempting to right the wrongness of this form.  The MC gets to tell you when you return to your original form.


###### Wild

Pick two of your forms and draw a line that connects them.  They have become bonded, and you cannot access one without the other.  If you want to shapeshift into one of these forms, you must become a **Chimera**, and incorporate all the bonded forms at once.

If you are not shapeshifted, immediately do so.  If you are shifted to a natural form, pick another form and become a chimera.  If you are already a chimera, roll again and only handle any misses.

###### Civil

If you have two forms that are bonded, you may erase the bond.  If not, cross out a form.  You may not access that form until you spend two consecutive nights somewhere away from civilization.

If you are shapeshifted, immediately return to your human form.

##### Floral-Feral:

Sometimes, your body is covered in thorns or spines, all protruding through your skin; say what they resemble (brambles, cactus, nettles, or something else?). They're not very comfortable but, for you, they're relatively safe.  Anyone else who gets pricked or scratched by them experiences terrible pain, or worse.

Other times, when your spines recede, you blossom instead. Your hair erupts with flowery, dazzling blooms. Your skin softens, turning velvety, as if you have become wrapped in the petals of a flower. Your breath smells of pine and fragrant pollen. Your saliva tastes of nectar.

All the flowers, fungus, herbs, and roots of the world heed your call. Some plants, when grown by you, can even produce special properties.  Pick two from the list to begin.  When you advance this feature, select another.

- **Forget-me-not**: When steeped into a tea induces a vivid hallucination of a forgotten memory.  Whoever drinks it will treat or add a Condition, your call.
- **Witch's Butter**: When turned into a paste and applied to the skin, causes a person to look older or younger, as wanted.
- **Devils Tooth**: Only grows on fresh, open wounds.  Staunches bleeding and seals the skin.  Reduces the Broken to a Wound.  If all Wounds are already marked the Break stays but the bearer can now act without aid.
- **Mandrake**: A foot-tall tuber-creature that will do your bidding for an hour or so, before it dies with a shrill screech.
- **Henbane**: When burned- and the fumes inhaled- lightens the body and allows the affected to walk on water or fall short distances without much impact.
- **Hellebore**: Worn as a necklace, protects from one magical effect against the wearer, then immediately withers.
- **Monkshod**: Whomever eats this is guaranteed to die in 24 hours.
- **Foxglove**: Sit silently and patiently near the plant for an hour or two and it will entice a local spirit or spectre for conversation.


###### Grow, My Pretties

A droplet of your blood in the soil can seed and grow into any plant.  Say what you want to grow from the list above, or name any mundane plant, then mark _wild_ and roll with **Feral Instincts**.  For each hit (max 2), choose one:
- It doesn't take much time.
- You grow enough for another use.
- You don't attract unwanted attention.

###### Wild

Your flowers wilt, and your spines extend.  If your spines are already out, name a poison.  Your spines secrete it like a venom.  You remain safe, but anyone else may be inflicted by the smallest scratch.

###### Civil

Your spines recede, and you flowers bloom. If your flowers are already bloomed, name a poison. Your saliva is laced with it. Harmless to you, but a kiss could spell disaster for anyone else.

---

##### **Hive-Host**

Your body provides a living nest to a swarm of critters. It bustles with all the din and fuss of a thriving community.  They are largely autonomous, self-sufficient, and independent (you are merely a host organism, after all; not their queen).  Yet, the relationship is symbiotic, and they do, in some fashion, abide your will.

Only the mature drones and militant members leave the hive, while the breeders and young remain inside. If the swarm is decimated, those members will repopulate in a short amount of time.

When you advance this feature, select a poison and add "The swarm injects my target with their venom" to the options for Swarm.  Only one poison may be afflicted at a time.

###### **Swarm**

When you release your swarm into the world, mark wild and roll with **Feral Instincts**.  For each hit (max 2), choose one:
- The swarm distracts, intimidates, or exhausts my target.
- The swarm Harms my target.
- The swarm is under my control afterward, and continues to do as I say.

###### Wild

The swarm erupts from your body, a chaotic and enraged cloud with allegiance to no creature, even yourself.  Likewise, they have no intention to return to their nest after the fact.  The rush depletes you; you cannot mark wild, or use any move that marks wild, for a full day.

###### Civil

The hive recedes into your body, dormant, restful.  It will not appear again, even if encouraged.  You can only draw it out again by tempting the swarm with a feast that it would greatly desire.

---

##### **Bark-Skinned**

The wilds are not merely a power you call upon or employ.  They have transformed you: physically, outwardly, undeniable and impossible to disguise.  You have become a wild monstrosity.  Pick one from the list below.  When you advance this feature, pick another.

- **Barkskin**: Your skin is as thick and rough as the bark of a great tree.  You are always Armored.
- **Stoneskin**: Your skin is as heavy and solid as stone.  You are always Heavily Armored, and also always _Clumsy_.
- **Owleye**: Your large, bright orange eyes are always able to see clearly, even it the darkest places.
- **Fishgill**: A set of gills where your ears and would be allows you to breathe easily in any situation.  Not just underwater, but in any place where a normal human would have difficulty.
- **Eagletalon**: Your fingertips end in hardened, treacherous talons.  Sharp as blades, they can be used as any knife would.
- **Vipertongue**: Your flickering, forked tongue can taste all aspects of the world around you.  You may ask the MC, at any time, "what here is obvious to me that human senses couldn't detect?", and the MC must answer truthfully.  
- **Scorpiontail**: You have a long, barbed tail.  Strong enough to hold your weight on its own, and dextrous enough to pick up and carry small objects.
- **Batwing**: The enormous, leathery wings attached to your sides and the undersides of your arms can be spread wide to glide through the air.  They're even usable for short bursts of flight.
- **Snakespine**: Instead of legs you have a slender, snaking body, covered in glistening reptilian scales.  Much longer that most people are tall.  You can slither along the ground, and through small spaces, like any snake could.

###### **Inhuman**

When you tap into the latent talents of your warped body, mark wild and tell the MC how you do something no human possibly could with their frail flesh and dull senses.

###### Wild

A feral urge overtakes you. What is it?  Write this urge as a condition. While you have this condition you may only **Defy Consequences** by marking wild.  If you get this condition a second time, you may not **Defy Conseqences**.

In addition to the standard means of clearing it, you can seek _catharsis_ by slaking the hungers that arise from this urge, or through _surrender_ by forcing yourself through an uptight, civil ritual (such as a formal dinner, dancing at a ball, or attending a lecture).

###### Civil

A feral urge rises in you, something so inhuman that it leaves you shaken, afraid of what you are.  What was the urge?  Write your fear of it as a condition. While you have this condition, you may only **Doctor Someone** if you also mark civil.  If you get this condition a second time, you may not **Doctor Someone**.

In addition to the standard means of clearing it, you can seek _catharsis_ by indulging in some extraordinarily human indulgence despite the difficulties of your body, or _surrender_ to it by unnecessarily putting yourself in a spot where your body draws unwanted attention or danger.

---

##### **Were-thing**

You have a beast inside of you.  Or, perhaps, you are a beast, and your ego is trapped inside it.  Maybe the two are one. Is this simply is who and what you are? A beast and a person, inseparable in nature, two eggs in the same shell?  The feeling ebbs and flows.  Some days it seems like one, some days the other.

Write down the name of a beast.  As your **Feral Instincts** grow wilder you further transform into a half-human hybrid of this beast- growing fur, scales, fangs, fins, and more. This transformation unlocks new capabilities (senses, strength, speed, and others) well beyond the capacities of your human body.  It also introduces unnatural hungers and impulses unbefitting a person.

When you advance this feature, name another beast.  Whenever you Wolf Out, choose one of your inner beasts to become.  That beast defines your looks, capabilities, and hungers until you choose a new one.

###### Wolf Out

When you give yourself over to your inner beast: choose which of your inner beasts takes over, mark wild, and roll with **Feral Instincts**.  For the rest of the scene you are transformed into a demihuman monster.

2+: your bestial hungers are under control.
1: pick one,
- your hunger overwhelms you.  Escalate the situation and cause collateral Harm or damage before you can regain a hold on yourself.
- you hold back the beast with great effort.  You're in a lousy spot now, the MC will tell you about it.
0: prepare for the worst.

###### Wild

Immediately Wolf Out (if you aren’t already) and Escalate the Situation, causing collateral Harm or damage as the bestial instincts overtake you.  You remain in your demihuman form until a friend or ally is able to Care for You.  You cannot mark civil again, or use any move that marks civil, until you are cared for.

###### Civil

Immediately return to your human form (if you were shifted). You lose touch with your bestial side and cannot mark wild again, or use any move that marks wild (including Wolf Out) until you've wolfed out again.  The next time you **Break Your Limits**, instead of the normal consequences, erase all conditions and then Wolf Out as if you rolled 2+.

### Moves

#### **Feral Instincts**

  |----|--|--|--|----|
Civil -1  0 +1 +2   Wild

You embody the struggle between wilderness and civilization. Start at 0. When a move says to mark wild, move your mark 1 step to the right. When a move says to mark civil, move it 1 to the left. Anytime the GM makes a move, they may shift your instincts civil or wild by 1.

When you reach wild your **Feral Instincts** overtake you. When you reach civil, you lose your connection to nature. In either case, mark 1 xp and follow your chosen feature for guidance.  After the effect subsides, your instinct returns to 0.


#### Get In Touch With Your Inner Human

Whenever you **Comfort and Care**, you can put a Feral Instinct at stake instead of a Condition.  If it works, mark civil.

#### **Limit Break**

Immediately push your **Feral Instincts** fully civil or wild, your choice.
