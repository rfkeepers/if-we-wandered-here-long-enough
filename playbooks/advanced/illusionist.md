## Core

### Features

#### A Reputation to Maintain

The first step to getting what you want is becoming the person that everyone else wants to help.  Or fear.  Or love.  Be the helpless fool, the villain, the coquette.  Be who they need you to be.  Once you have what they need, they'll come begging to give you what you need.

When creating this character, first choose one of the featured Reputations.  This is _you_.  Or, at least, the you that you've always shown to everyone else.

Second, write down answers to each of the following questions. Always keep them tucked underneath your character sheet.  Whether or not you share the answers with the table while you create this character is up to you.

- What is it about yourself that you want to hide?
- What part of your image do you wish you could become, but never will?
- Is your goal to one day drop the veil and live as yourself, or to erase yourself and become the image you created?


##### Innocent

Trouble?  You've never heard the word. Just see here: clean hands, shiny boots, and had you ever told a lie in your life then surely you'd have a wrinkle on your face from the stress of it by now!

**RP**:〚 〛

###### Wield Your Image

Whenever you make a show of your own helplessness and ask someone to aid you, all but the most callous souls are willing to lend you a hand.  And for little more payment than a smile and a "thank you"!  Burn 2 RP and they'll even help you with oddly incriminating tasks.

###### Burn Your Image

Burn 1 RP when you take matters into your own hands or solve a difficult problem.  Burn 2 RP to threaten, kill, or seize something by force.

###### Show Your Desperation

These are dangerous places you're in, and a person like you really shouldn't be here. People start going out of their way to get you out of this situation.  They may heavily suspect your ally's credibility, bringing someone like you along.


###### End-Of-Session Questions

- Did your character see me make a feeble, failing attempt to help out today?
- Did your character see me selflessly (or stupidly) give my resources away today?

##### Ascetic

A good life is achieved through austerity and willpower.  To deny yourself indulgence is to stay pure.  And purity always leads to blessings.

**RP**:〚 〛

###### Wield Your Image

No matter the company that surrounds you, you stand out as a beacon of moral grounding and honest reliability. NPCs will always defer to you for safekeeping of goods and information.  When you offer to keep something of theirs safe, if they'd possibly part with it, they let you have it.  Burn 2 RP if you ever get separated from it or leave it in a risky spot.

###### Burn Your Image

Burn 1 RP whenever you spend wealth on yourself for any unnecessary purchase.  Burn 2 RP when you indulge in drink, leaf, leisure, or company.

###### Show Your Desperation

A person who lives only to deny themselves isn't truly living at all, wouldn't you agree? Too much deprivation parches the soul.  It's good to quench the thirst now and again. At least, that's what those who have targeted you as their mark would have you think.

###### End-Of-Session Questions

- Did your character see me deny myself comfort or pleasure today?
- Did your character see me labor intensively and without complaint today?

##### Brutal

You are _not_ someone to be trifled with.  Trifle around and find out if you want.  It's your funeral.

**RP**:〚 〛

###### Wield Your Image

Your very presence gives others cold sweat and clammy palms. Any weak-willed person that recognizes you has their feelings written all over their face.  Ask the MC, "who here is plotting against me or would cower to me?" and they'll answer honestly.  Burn 2 RP and you can affect strong-willed people as well, though you may need to introduce yourself to them.

###### Burn Your Image

Burn 1 RP anytime you bend to begging, or if you have the opportunity to call in a debt, but don't.  Burn 2 RP to endure an insult or provocation without retaliation.

###### Show Your Desperation

The wolves have the scent of weakness in their noses, and have come out for the hunt. You'd best watch your back.

###### End-Of-Session Questions

- Did your character see me exploit someone else's weakness or cowardice today?
- Did your character see me give someone a merciless or callous end today?

##### Royal

You have not once simply entered a room. You are first announced. Or, if not announced, presented. Or if not that, you can present yourself. Simply being there? Phah. They all should know who you are, and spread word of your arrival.

**RP**:〚 〛

###### Wield Your Image

You can demand an audience with anyone and they'll acquiesce to the request.  However, the meeting is on their terms; you only get to decide whether they come alone, if you can bring friends, or the time and place of the meeting.  Burn 2 RP and it's on your terms: where, when, and with whom.

###### Burn Your Image

Burn 1 RP when you reject summons or invitations.  Burn 2 RP when you avoid attention or scrutiny by denying your own importance or value.

###### Show Your Desperation

Every faltering royal needs an advisor, don't you think? If not an advisor, how about a business opportunity? A suitor? A concubine? A new best friend? There's always someone looking for an unused foothold to help them step up in the world.

###### End-Of-Session Questions

- Did your character watch me manage a situation with dignity and power today?
- Did your character watch me treat someone as _beneath me_ today?

##### Untamed

You've got yourself, and that's all you really need. No one else needs to look after you or tend to your business. No one else needs to dress your wounds or lock away your fears. You're part of a functioning party, not part of a family.

**RP**:〚 〛

###### Wield Your Image

You may be solitary and reserved, but others recognize your, shall we say, success rate. Makes you a valuable member of any team. So when you say you want to go along with the group, people tend to make room for you. Burn 2 RP and they'll even let you bring any of your friends along with you.

###### Burn Your Image

Burn 1 RP to let someone do a simple or burdensome task (cook, clean, mend gear, carry stuff, etc) on your behalf. Burn 2 RP to let someone protect you or get in the way of danger on your behalf while you're still able to act on your own.

###### Show Your Desperation

Taking on the world all by yourself would be impossible for most people; difficult even for the best out there. It's no wonder that you attract such admirers. What kind of champion would one have to be to win your favor?

###### End-Of-Session Questions
- Did your character see me quietly suffer though a tough situation today?
- Did your character see me turn away help or favors today?

##### Anonymous

You're no-one.  A background character.  Set dressing.  Do you even have a name?  Not that anyone would remember it.

**RP**:〚 〛

###### Wield Your Image

Whenever you cover or conceal your identifying features (face, hair, tattoos, scars, special items, etc), you are only recognizable to those who are very familiar with you.  Anyone else who notices you has no idea who you are, if they remember the moment at all. You may Burn 2 RP and no one (no matter how well they know you) can recognize you.  Not until you reveal your identity, or the scene ends.

###### Burn Your Image

Burn 1 RP whenever you make yourself the center of attention.  Burn 2 RP if you intentionally get the attention of a crowd or important person.

###### Show Your Desperation

Everyone can see how much you long to be noticed, even when you're lurking in the background. That kind of yearning has an odd way of attracting the kind of people who are looking to help folks out.

###### End-Of-Session Questions

- Did your character forget I was around at any point today?
- Did your character think I looked reserved, quiet, and unconfrontational today?

### Moves

#### Reputation Play

A good reputation is the key to everything.  "Trustworthy" isn't about charisma in the moment.  It's about maintaining an unwavering image, time and time and again.

Every time you gain a new Reputation (including creating this character), it starts with 2 Reputation Points (aka, RP).  Moves (or the MC) can make you increase or decrease that count.  RP may go negative, you'll just have to dig yourself out of that hole.

"Burning" RP means decreasing your Reputation Points. This means you either did something directly counter to the tenets of that image, or that you besmirched your own name overall.  Whenever you burn your RP down to 0 or lower, some cracks appear in your facade, and you **Show Your Desperation**.  Tell the MC when this happens (or if you're in this state when the session starts) and read them the consequences from your Reputation.

At the end of the session, ask each player at the table the questions associated with your current Reputations (do this separately for each reputation).  If at least one player answers yes, to any question, gain 1 Reputation.  If all players answer yes, gain 2 Reputation.


#### Smoke & Mirrors

When you craft a small, temporary illusion to fool the senses, say what effect you want the illusion to have (scare them, entice them, trick them, distract them, etc), describe what it looks like, and then roll it.

On a hit, you get the desired effect.
2+: choose 1 from below.
1: choose 2.
0: prepare for the worst.  The MC makes a move.

- It's only enough for a brief moment.  Who gets to capitalize on that opportunity: you, or someone else (say who)?
- This one fools them, but now they know your trick and won't be fooled again for the rest of the scene.
- Someone important wasn't affected.  Say whom.

If you ever need a more permanent or convincing illusion, try a **Ritual** instead.


#### Reinvent Yourself

When you **Take A Fatal Injury**, you cannot take a _lasting reminder_ or _emotional scar_.  Instead you may permanently destroy one of your chosen reputations.  Describe how you leave that life behind and replace it with a new one, then choose another Reputation in its place.

If you can't take on a new Reputation (they're all destroyed or unappealing), you cannot use this move.  Your could always _make a deal with an entity_ or _go out in a blaze of glory_.  Or, you can truly reinvent yourself.  Pick a new playbook and start again from the beginning.


#### Walk the Walk

A key part of gaining a reputation is the ability to back it up.  Whenever you add a new Reputation, take one move from any playbook that isn't in use by another player.  When you **Reinvent Yourself**, you lose this move.


#### Limit Break

Your veil slips, and before you realize what you've done you reveal your true nature: a glimpse at your real, unimagined self. Tell the table what you did, or are doing, that gives you away.

The moment you catch yourself, you have to make a choice:
- Remain exposed.  Let another player ask you a question from **Read the Room**.  Give them the kind of honest answer that you could only give in this moment.  All your Reputations gain 2 RP.

- Conceal, don't feel.  Make a fuss about how they've got it all wrong, if you have to.  Burn 2 RP from all your Reputations.
