# Creating a Character

Character creation is, at this stage of the game, both very simple and very raw.  This section is a loose guide the steps you would take if you had, y'know, a character sheet to write these things down on.

The overall process goes like this:

1. Choose your playbook.
2. Pick 2 _Approaches_.
3. Assign 2 total points to your _Defiance_.
4. Follow the choices in your playbook's _Core Feature_.
5. (imagine this step, it isn't written) Pick your starting equipment.
6. Give your character a name, pronouns, and (also not yet written) choose your looks.

And, probably, some starter questions for generating relationships, backstory, setting, and npcs.  So much to do.

## Approaches

This game is, ostensibly, statless.  In place of stats, each playbook comes with a list of _Approaches_.  An approach is a broad statement about how the character likes to solve a problem. Similar to dumping points into a certain stat so that you can showcase the qualities related to it ("I want to be the strongest!"), approaches are all about pointing your character towards certain behavior when they're in the spotlight.

Your character's fundamental capability is never called into question. You are all capable people; that much is a given. But you're not all equally capable. Some of you will naturally be stronger, more aware, or more alluring than the others. How are you supposed to know, without stats?  You speak it into the fiction. Say to the table, "I think I'm the strongest person around," and if everyone agrees then it's true.

Don't expect to gain all of the approaches on your character sheet. Even with a character who has filled out all of their advancements you'll only get about half of those. However! Advancements are one of the kinds of multiclassing in this game.  As you level up you'll get to add Approaches from other playbooks, to really round out the uniqueness of your character.

Everyone at the table is expected (and encouraged!) to interpret Approaches with a generous amount of flexibility. Playing too strict with the statements as written will suffocate the mechanic. If it feels intuitive (event at a slant) to match the action to the proposed approach, go ahead and do it.

## Defiance

> (Side note: more on this in [[DEEP_BLUE/rules/defiance.md]]).

Characters begin the game with 2 total points of _Defiance_, which can be distributed across their four Defiances: Force, Skill, Charm, and Intuition. The distribution can either stack both points on a single defiance, or split them between two. 

Do the names of those four defiances sound a bit like stats? They probably do, but don't let that confuse you. Defiances are a kind of resource you can spend to get yourself out of trouble. The number you put down is the maximum number of times you can use that Defiance between rests.

So which one is the right one for you? Think about it like this: you're on stage, in the center of the spotlight, facing the audience and pouring your heart into the scene, when you trip and fall!  How do you want to save yourself in that moment? That's what a defiance does: it lets you recover from a stumble. The only question is _how_ you do it.

## Core Features

The "abilities" in every playbook are divided into two sections: Core Features and Advanced Moves.  When you create a character you only get to pick from the Core Features (which will come packed with some moves right away).

Most playbooks offer a list of Feature options and, depending on the playbook, you'll get to pick one or two. The options you didn't pick may become available again as a level-up advancement, but not always. Some playbooks are locked into their feature choice for the remainder of the game.  If you aren't sure, check the level-up advancements to see how that playbook will change over time.

All the other moves listed in the Core section of the playbook are yours right away.  No choices to make there.

### Side Note: Limit Breaks

Each playbook comes with a core move called **Limit Break**. You won't have to worry about that right now. It comes into play when your character gains too many _Conditions_ (a type of [[DEEP_BLUE/rules/harm.md]]).
