## Core Features

### Schools of Magic

The Prima Principa of arcanistry set forth five _axioms_, and, through those _axioms_, a multitude of _virtues_, defining the cosmology of all.  It is with these _axioms_ that the world may manifest as stable and contiguous law.  Leveraging stable law, the _virtues_ beget motion, birth, and entropy.  And by motion that we master the _virtues_ to wrest the law of all from the _axioms_.  Thus do we shape the cycle.

At character creation, mark two _Axioms_ and gain their Adept _virtues_. You can only **Ply the Arcane** from _Axioms_ you've marked.

- Adept: _Create a fleeting_
- Expert: _Focus, Bend_
- Master: _Swallow, Radiate_

**Spatia** (_Space_, _Sound_)

- Expert: _Connect_
- Master: _Collapse_

## Core Moves

###### Ply the Arcane

When you have a couple controlled moments to safely manipulate reality by arcane procedure: combine an _axiom_ and _virtue_ from your available schools, say what you want to happen, and roll it.

On a Hit, you cast the spell, more or less like you intended.

2+: Choose one from below.
1: Choose two.

- Something goes awry; the MC will add an “and” or “but” to its effect.
- You're unable to manipulate or disperse the effect afterward.
- You draw unwanted attention.

0: How badly can you warp reality by trying to make the fundamental laws of the universe lie to themselves? The MC will say. Prepare for the worst.

###### Sorcerer

When you **Ply the Arcane** in haste, by instinct, or through sudden reaction, roll 2 dice and set them aside, then roll Ply the Arcane.  Compare the dice rolled by each move.  If either Sorcerer die matches a number on a Ply the Arcane die, do the following:

If at least one die matches: the spell is warped, surprising, or tumultuous.  The MC makes a move.

If both dice match: pick one of the entries from the table below.  It must match one of the dice rolled by Sorcerer.  This effect replaces the _Axiom_ or _Virtue_ you intended to wield.

1. Axiom: **Anima** (Life, Spirit)
2. Axiom: **Sors** (Fate)
3. Axiom: **Aevum** (Time)
4. Virtue: _A thousand butterflies of..._, _streaming ribbons of..._
5. Virtue: _A thick fog of..._, _a steady rainstorm of..._
6. Virtue: _Reverse_, _shatter_, _distort_

###### Limit Break

You gain a sudden- maybe even apocryphal- understanding of how the universe truly is, or how it should be, or how you need it to be.  An epiphany so thorough and absolute that before you can come to terms with it you've bled the idea into the fabric of reality: the world around you now holds the belief as firmly as you do.

Select one of your _axioms_ and one of your _virtues_; tell them to the MC, then explain this new epiphany, and how those things fit into it.  The MC will explain how the world around you reshapes itself to those new truths.
