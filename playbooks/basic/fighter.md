## Core

### Feature

#### The Making of a Titan

You are a walking weapon. Hammered and folded until your bones no longer snap and your flesh denies any dull blade. The human body, _your_ human body- its inadequate limits and deficient capabilities- was only one more trial to pass. How could mere flesh hold you back?  What power does it have to define you?  None.

##### Tank —

You ignore all negative tags (such as _Heavy_ and _Clumsy_) from being _Heavily Armored_ or holding shields.  Any armor you wear is impervious to mundane damage.

Anytime your feet are firmly planted on the ground, you cannot be toppled or pushed by any force that wouldn't kill you outright.

##### Monster —

You gain the Druid feature **Bark-Skinned**.  Pick one option from the list and gain the move **Inhuman**, but do not take **Feral Instincts**.  Instead of marking wild, you must take a Condition.

##### Behemoth —

You're equal to three people in any battle, brawl, wrestling match, or standoff.  Size, strength, skill, scariness, whatever; you name it.

Once per session, when you **Pressure Someone** with physical intimidation, threats of violence, or by offering aid in labor or protection, that character must acquiesce (unless the request is so unreasonable that they couldn't, or would never, commit themselves to it).

##### Sword Saint —

Create a weapon (TODO: rules ref), or choose one you already own: give it a name (if it doesn't have one), and some magical properties (if it has none).  None may match you in combat so long as you have your weapon.  Once per scene, when rolling while using this weapon, swap the result of any roll for a 2+.

If this weapon breaks or is lost, you may spend a **Level Up** to replace it.

##### Ogre —

Add an extra slot to each of your _Pains_ and _Wounds_.  When you **Interfere**, or **Risk Everything** and sacrifice your body, any Injury you take will be- at worst- a Pain.

When you taunt a target you become the center of its attention until something bigger or meaner than you takes it back.

##### Mage Hunter —

Every hair and nerve on your body is attuned to the prickle of magic. The way that it raises your hackles and roils shivers across your skin. The MC must warn you about magical attacks and traps against you before they happen.

Take the Resource: **Spellbreaker**
- Save: you forcefully turn aside, block, or break a magical effect.
- One use.
- Refreshes at the end of the scene.

##### Demon —

Something seeded itself in you, infecting your bones, reshaping your body. An entity looking for a host? A symbiotic creature that coils itself around your muscles? Some warping of your self by an ancient evil?  Say what it is, even if your character wouldn't know.

Any time you tap into the unnatural strength of your reshaped body, you can say your attack or physical action gains the tags _Forceful_, _Savage_, _Ruinous_, or all of them. In fact, sometimes you aren't able to hold back- the MC will let you know.


### Moves

#### What are you, Immortal?

Your body is outrageously durable.  You can get thrown through walls, catapulted into the aid, flung aside, and bashed into the floor, yet always get back to your feet again.

Even when _broken_, you don't need additional aid to take action.

#### Limit Break

Answer the following question by writing down the first thing that comes to mind: what would be the most cathartic thing for your to do right now?  It should be something big. Something that would really help you blow off some steam.  Wrestle a bear?  Drink yourself into oblivion?  Punch the Marquis right in his goddamn face?

Take out a note card and write your answer on it.

Next, before erasing four conditions for **Breaking Your Limits**, write down those four conditions this same card.  Those four conditions are locked to your catharsis. Now go ahead and erase them from your character sheet.They still affect you, just like if you had them on your character sheet.  You are not allowed to erase any condition from this card, under any circumstance, until you get that catharsis taken care of.

Tuck that card under your character sheet. When you achieve the want you wrote on the card you can tear it up, releasing those conditions along with it.
