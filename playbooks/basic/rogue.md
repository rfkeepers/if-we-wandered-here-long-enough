## Core

### Features

#### Tricks of the Trade

People waste so much effort trying to get what they want. The overmuscled gorillas hacking through stone walls and brainy bobble-heads trying to tear and stitch reality itself. The world is far more simple than that.  See it, want it, take it. Armor? Slide a blade between the gaps. Courtship? Steal a kiss during a dance. Locks? Find a key- or make one. Problems? Leave them behind. Simple and direct is always the best.

##### Escape Art

_Trick_: Slip free of any binding: cuffs, locked rooms, magical influence, contracts, etc.
_Risk_: You leave something behind, or pick up something new, in the act of getting free: ask or tell the MC what it is.

##### Shadowstep

_Trick_: Push your body into one shadow and out another.
_Risk_: Either you can move the shadow itself like a puppet (but not pass through it), or you get caught or stuck halfway through; say which.

##### Call in a Favor

_Trick_: Describe an NPC (who are they, what do they look like, what's their deal with you?) and then either add them to the scene (tell the MC how they appear) or add a helpful Resource that they snuck in for you sometime earlier (tell the MC what it is).
_Risk_: You owe them a _debt_ for the help.

##### Sword-spell

_(can be taken twice)_

Pick a school from the wizard's core features.  You gain access to that schools properties, as well as its Adept verbs (you can get the Expert verb by taking the same school a second time).  Additionally, gain the following Adept (first time) or Expert (second time) verbs.

Adept: _Conjure a Shiv of..._
Expert: _Throw a Blade of..._

_Trick_: **Ply the Arcane** by combining a verb and substance from your available schools, then say what you want to happen.
_Risk_: The result is not exactly what you wanted; the GM will add an “and” or “but” to its effect.

##### Prestidigitation

_Trick_: Take an item from someone's person, or put an item on their person, undetected.
_Risk_: They'll figure out that it was you, later.

##### Trick Shot

_Trick_: Take a shot so complicated or unlikely it seems impossible.
_Risk_: Either you cause unintended damage or harm, or bring extra attention to yourself.

##### Forgery

_Trick_: Create a replica accurate enough to convince anyone that it's authentic: falsify a document, cobble together a disguise, produce or mar a set of evidence, simulate birdsong, etc.
_Risk_: Now or later, either someone you wronged will come looking to you for the truth, or someone who benefit from the fake will get disproportionately punished; the MC decide say which.

### Moves

#### Roguish Trades

When you take a risk and employ one of your feature Tricks, answer the following questions, take +1 for each "yes", and roll it.

- Are you swindling, cheating, stealing, conning, killing, or setting someone up?
- Are you proving to someone that you're ruthless, cold, fabulous, or sexy?

On a hit you do it.  On 1, the risks manifest.  On 0, prepare for the worst.


#### Cheater

Anytime you roll, you can trade any two d6 for one d8 in their place.  You can do this multiple times.  If any d8 rolls an 8, ask or tell the MC how you get even more than expected.

Or, you can trade any number of d6s for d8s straight up.  If you do that, the MC gets to make an extra move (as hard as they want) for every d8 that rolls a 1.

If you make both kinds of trade in the same roll, the extra results on 1 and 8 apply to all d8s.


#### Limit Break

You gain a new _Obsession_: it must be something you could plausibly get (eg: coin from the dragon's hoard, the queen's rapier, a night with the Marquis, etc).  What is it?

Don't write this obsession down as a Condition.  Write it in your approaches; it will remain there until you get it for yourself, or until that part of you so completely changes that you'd never want it again.  Much like the condition, you may use `Pursue Your Obsession` like any other approach.  There is no limit to the number of obsessions you can obtain.
