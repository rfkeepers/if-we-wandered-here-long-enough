# Playbook Overview

The playbooks in this game are split into two categories: basic and advanced. The difference is mostly in how easily the average players might find it to simply pick up and play with that playbook.

## Basic Playbooks

The basic playbooks are all straightforward: their identity lies on some direct vector, and their moves all point in that same direction.

Generating one of these characters should only take a couple minutes.  You probably won't need to have any extra conversation with the table to pitch your character's purpose or motivations.

They're also the easiest to have multiples of at the same table, since their features allow them to fragment identity across builds with more variation.

### Fighter

You're the muscle and the weapons of the group, able to body people and monsters with equal ease. If this were an anime, you'd be the kind of powerhouse that has their own gravitational pressure: simply standing in your presence can get difficult.

Unlike other rpgs, where every character is expected to wear armor, swing a sword, and cleave through opponents abreast the other party members, this job is uniquely yours.   Other characters may start or enter a fight, sure. You're the one who is made to end fights.

### Rogue

You're the trickster, able to approach any situation sideways. It's all about finding a way to do something with less effort. Lieing, cheating, stealing, that's all fair game. The only true rule is to get what you want.

### Wizard

You are a committed student of the arcane, of the ways that reality can be shaped and refracted. Being a wizard in this game isn't about casting fireballs (though there are ways to do that, if you really want).  It's much weirder here.  You get a toolbox with a somewhat absurd range of options.  What you do with them is up to you.

This playbook halfway to being advanced.  It's simple to set up, and doesn't require any extra conversation.  But the things you can do with it could, very literally, break the universe. In the face of such power, most problems get pretty trivialized.  So here's a warning and appeal: don't try to do that.  Get gonzo with your magic; do mind-bending things; but don't use it to invalidate your problems.

## Advanced Playbooks

The advanced playbooks are taking bigger swings with the mechanics. Character creation, identity, and mechanics may all be more involved than the basic ones.

In particular, you'll want to keep two things in mind (and also verbally communicated with the table) when creating an advanced playbook.  First, it's going to take a longer time to do compared to the basic playbooks.

Second, most importantly, these playbooks may impose constraints or implications about the larger setting: where you expect the story to take place, what kind of story you want to tell, or whether the other players need to buy in to your character concept to make the mechanics work without friction.  Take the time you need to have these conversations with your fellow players before you commit to the character.

### Cleric

What does it mean to wield power that's not your own? To be beholden to it? The strength given to you is a greatness beyond that of any equivalent mortal. But it isn't yours. You're a vessel, a tool, or a contractor.  You simply get to use it, for as long as that power deems fitting.

The Cleric wraps up a couple archetypical themes into one package.  A servant of a religion, certainly. But also warlocks (who work through contracts), those who make sacrifices for power, and those who are divinely chosen. The central theme isn't necessarily about churches and deities (though it can be about that, if you want).  It's about relationships with any greater power.

### Druid

Wild child, spawn of the forest, animal kin, sibling of monsters. There are a hundred more names you could go by. Could, but you won't, because you know the truth: they're all the same name.  Other.  Not of our ken.

The druid's core identity can take a lot of forms: animal shapeshifter, plant-person, half-human and half-beast, werewolf, a living hive.  They're all centered around the same concept.  Being part of the wilderness places you outside civilization. You don't belong, and people know it.  The way you choose to showcase that identity (ie, your chosen feature) is up to you, all of those paths will have you in conflict with where you stand in society.

### Illusionist

What is a person if not a pile of secrets?  What is an identity, if not one more secret on the pile?  A mask behind which is some other truth.  Though behind that mask could lie yet another one, and so on until you have to start asking, after all those masks, whether a truth buried so deeply is any more real than the falsehoods before it.

Playing an Illusionist can be difficult for two reasons.  First, keeping track of the mechanics of a false identity can add a bit of burden when thinking through the moment-to-moment play.  Second, it's natural (though not at all necessary) to use this playbook to explore playing _against_ your fellow PCs in some way.  If you plan to foster any kind of conflicting goals or purposes, it's always best to get buy-in from everyone at the table before committing to the character.

### Traveler

The traveler is... an experiment.  I (the developer) am going to pull back the veil here and lay this one out plainly.  There's a collection of archetypes that seem, to me, to all operate on central theme of worldliness and otherness. Traditionally, ultimately, they each depend on a specific battle mechanic to actually become a unique class. Ranger?  Bows and pets. Bard? Song-buffing and half-mage. Barbarian? Rage.

It's not that these concepts couldn't have made a good playbook on their own right. But here I wanted to hone in on that worldliness- that sense of knowing and understanding things that other characters couldn't- rather than the battle archetypes.

As a result: the Traveler. A loosely connected set of mini-archetypes. Playing a Traveler can be a bit tricky in that some of the playbooks need to shape the fiction and space of play to really make sense.  The Monarch needs a throne to sit on.  The Outlaw should have the law on their heels. The shopkeep has a literal shop somewhere, and they probably need to get back to check on it pretty frequently.  Make sure these details are addressed when creating characters, before moving on with the rest of play, otherwise the table might not be ready to help you play out this character.
