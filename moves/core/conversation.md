# As Conversations

Conversation moves are frames for handling the fiction through pure conversation.  So, they're moves that use conversation for resolution, not moves that resolve character conversation.  

Why have a move at all, if it doesn't involve a random resolution?  Because procedure still matters. It helps everyone at the table understand the ways that the game expects them to declare expectations, commit to stakes, and manage the consequences.

All of these moves operate on an unspoken rule that the established fiction (both the previously stated truths about a character as well as the facts on their character sheet) still have a hand in determining the success and consequences. They may not be referred to directly -no move will tell you to check if the character has a matching Approach or Resource- but these things should count in the evaluation in some way.

###### Defy Consequences

When you defy fate and narrowly save yourself from terrible Harm or danger at the last moment, narrate how you do it and spend any one **Save** that matches the action.  If you have no appropriate Saves, you cannot defy the consequence; check out **Take Harm** instead.

###### Pressure Someone

When you pressure someone to do something for you against their better judgement, tell the owner of that character (usually the MC) what you want them to do, and how you approach asking (or compelling) them to do it.  That owner chooses one from the following options:

- It's simply not possible.  You get to ask them two questions from "Read the Room".
- They need payment (maybe more than you already offered); up front is fine, though a _Debt_ to them is just as good.  If you're calling in a debt you have on them, that works just as well.
- They won't keep this transgression to themselves; they'll do it, but someone is going to find out about your involvement.
- Okay, fine, they'll do it. If this is between players, the pressuring player takes a Condition.

The way you approach pressuring a character will influence which option their player picks. Assume that every character will cave to easily to certain pressures yet stand resistant to others.

###### Overcome an Adversary

When you have dismantled or broken through all of your adversary's defences and resistances (or gained an unlikely opportunity and slipped between them), you may strike the final blow and overcome them.  No rolls, no second chances- you just do it.  You've earned that opportunity.  Say how.

Getting past your adversary's defences is not flavor text, it's a requirement.  Every adversary has a list of Resources they can use to defend themselves.  If any of them are active and applicable the MC will bring them to bear against you, thwarting the final blow.

"Overcoming" can take many forms: killing them, breaking their spirit, turning the community against them, getting them to finally admit that they're in love with you, and so on.  What it means, in whatever form it takes, is that your adversary no longer has the power to stand in your way.  Maybe just for now, maybe permanently.

Similarly, an "Adversary" can be interpreted as liberally as you want.  It doesn't have to be combative, or even antagonistic.  It's anyone or anything that prevents you from achieving what you want. The player tells the MC what they want, and the MC says they can't have it yet: now you have an adversary.

###### Help Out

When you try to help another character do something that would have been difficult or impossible on their own, first answer the following questions.

1. Are you protecting them from incoming Harm or Danger?  If so, use **Interfere** instead.
2. Does their Move already explain what happens if others are involved?  If so, follow those rules instead.
3. Is this character an NPC?  If so, the conversation should spotlight you, not them.

Otherwise, you can join them, and in doing so open yourself up to all of the same Harm and danger that could befall whomever you're helping.  Pick the one that best fits the situation:

- They're able to act despite an Injury.
- They couldn't have done it alone, but the two of you together can do it.
- They accomplish more than they could have just by themselves.

###### Produce a Resource

When you take a moment and search through your supplies and pull out a Resource, tell the MC what you're getting, mark off the supply you're using up (the supply type must match the kind of Resource you want to produce); now you have it.

If you're going to use up the whole Resource right away, just do it.  If you're going to carry it around with you for a while, create a new Resource card and add it to your character sheet.

Every Resource must describe:
- what it is.
- whether it does anything special.
- if it's limited in use, how many uses it has.
- if it can be refreshed, when it refreshes.
- if it can be damaged without being destroyed, how much damage it can take.
- if it expires, and if so, when.

Resources produced from Supply always have 0 worth.  Though they may still be valuable to a particular someone or something.

###### Conjure Through Ritual

When you have time and safety to dedicate yourself to an arcane ritual, tell the MC what you're trying to achieve, and they'll tell you one or more of the following requirements.

- You need additional knowledge to understand what you need to do; the help of an expert or a guiding diagram would do the trick.  Tell the MC where you can find what you need.
- You need some rare ingredients and supplies.  Tell the MC which, and where you can find them.
- You'll need to sacrifice something important.  Perhaps something specific (if so, the MC will tell you what it is).
- It's going to take you a long time to complete the ritual, the MC will tell you exactly how long.
- The ritual can only be performed at a certain place and/or time.
- You're going to attract a lot of attention in the process.
- It's going to create some result you didn't plan on, the MC will say what it is.
- You'll need to Roll it.  On a hit: you do it.  On 1: something has gone wrong, the MC will add some "and"s and/or "but"s to the result. On 0: prepare for the worst.

When you meet all the requirements and the Ritual is complete, the effect comes to pass.
