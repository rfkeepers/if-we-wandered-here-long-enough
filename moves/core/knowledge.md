# Gathering Knowledge

Knowledge moves are all about retrieving additional information or understanding about the world, your current situation, or the people around you.

###### Read the Room

When you take a moment to get a read on a character or situation (figuring out motives, weaknesses, design, or the sitch in general): tell the MC what you're doing to gain this information, ask one question from the list below, and roll it.

- Who’s really in control here?
- What here is out of place, shouldn't be here, or doesn't fit in?
- What should I be on the lookout for, now or later?
- What's the best way in/around/through/out of here?
- Who or what is vulnerable or open to me?
- What happened here recently, or is about to happen?

If you're getting a read on a specific character, you can also choose from these questions:

- What is your motivation at this moment?
- What subtle signals are you sending?
- What are you avoiding or hiding from?

On a Hit, the MC will answer your question.

2+: Ask two more questions as follow-up.

1: You can ask another question from the list if you want, but you'll draw attention to yourself in the process.

0: Tell the MC what answer you were hoping for.  They'll stymie or thwart what you wanted.  Afterwards, they make a Move.

###### Research the World

When you search a source of knowledge (perusing a library, pouring over a book, conversing with an expert, or wracking your own memory) for important information about a subject: tell the MC what you're trying to learn, answer the questions below and take +1 if any answer is a "yes", then roll it.

- Do you have a personal history with the source of knowledge? ("your memory" doesn't count here.)
- Are you already an expert in this field or subject?  Enough to discern truth from fiction?
- Is the source of knowledge overflowing with valuable information or eager to help you?

2+: the MC will tell you about it with rich detail, provide additional context, and any follow-up questions will get the same treatment.

1: You'll get a flat, terse answer.  It may not teach you everything you need to know.  Follow-up questions will be similarly limited.

0: Tell the MC what answer you were hoping for.  They'll stymie or thwart what you wanted.  Afterwards, they make a Move.

###### Dig Up a Secret

Tell or ask the MC what you're looking for (answers, treasures, secret paths, etc); they'll say if it's here, hidden from you. When you get to work finding it, answer the questions below and take Advantage if any answer is a "yes", then roll it.  You always find what you're looking for, no matter the outcome of the roll.

- Do you wreck the place, break valuables, or hurt people in the process?
- Do you have a guide, map, or directions to the thing handy?

2+: you find it, exactly how you wanted it.  
1: choose one:
- You take Harm in the process of finding it (or maybe the thing itself harms you).
- Getting to it puts you in a lousy spot (ambushed by foes, caught in a trap, in the center of attention, etc).
- You break something valuable in the process.

0: You find something else as well (something cursed, something unwanted, bad news, an ill portent, etc).  The MC will say what it is, and why it's a problem that you found it.  Afterwards, they make a Move.
