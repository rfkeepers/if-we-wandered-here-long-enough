# Common Actions

Action moves cover the "actions" your character can take.  Summarily: taking things from other characters, getting up in the way of danger, and performing acts of desperation.  It may not seem like much, but these form the whole core of "doing things" in this game.  All the other moves are directed at downtime, information gathering, or clarifying procedures.

If you haven't read the section about what's different in this game yet, you should keep in mind while reading these moves that none of them are intended as a catch-all or act-under-fire kind of action.  That sort of thing gets handled by the conversation, not by rolls.

###### Separate

When you try to separate a character from something they have and wouldn't give up willingly (an item, a limb, their authority, a belief, etc), answer the following questions and then roll it.

What are you separating, from whom, and how? Can they be separated from it right now? (If not, do not roll.) Are you going to get put in danger or take Harm in the process?

On a hit, you separate them from it.

2+: Pick one,
- Gain possession of it for yourself.
- Destroy it.
- Avoid any danger.
- Ask them any one question and they must answer honestly. If the character is incapable of communication, ask anyway, the MC will answer to the best of their ability.

1: The MC picks one,
- You're separated from something of yours in the process. It may still be nearby, or it could be lost or broken.
- You're in a lousy spot afterward.
- Someone or something else gets put in danger.

0: Maybe you separate it, maybe not.  Either way, the MC gets to make a move as hard as they want.  Prepare for the worst.

###### Interfere

When you put yourself in the path of danger (a sword, an insult, an assassination contract, the marquis, etc) to divert attention or provide protection, roll it (the MC must tell you if you'll get put in danger before you roll).  Regardless of the outcome you take on that problem and all of consequences that come with stepping in front of it.

On a hit, choose one:
- You avoid any consequences to yourself. (only if consequences were established)
- You capture the target's attention, providing an opportunity to an ally.
- You move the danger elsewhere or decide where it's headed.

On 1, choose pick:
- You end up in a lousy spot or draw attention to yourself.
- Your target retains their position or advantage over the situation.

0: The MC makes a move; prepare for the worst.

###### Risk Everything

When you're desperate enough to trade your survival or standing to get what you want: tell the MC about the crazy stunt you're trying to pull. If they say it's at all possible, decide what sacrifices you're willing to make (answer the questions below).

Are you willing to sacrifice...
- your body? (take an Injury, the MC will tell you how severe).
- your heart? (take a Condition, the MC will say which).
- your resources? (destroy a resource or item of significant value).
- your control over the situation? (you'll end in a terrible spot afterward, and grant your antagonist a clear opening).
- your allies? (say how you drag another character into this; the MC will Harm or endanger them).
- your reputation? (take a burden, the MC will say which).
- your luck? (spend 2 Saves; say how you narrowly avoid further danger).

Your chosen sacrifices happen no matter what comes next.  You are not allowed to Defy them.  Write those down first, then roll with the sacrifices.

2+: You do it.  Oh, you lucky fool.  You did it.  
1: You do it, but the cost is so much greater than you expected.  Either the MC doubles down on one or more of your sacrifices (pay their price again), or they make a separate move as hard as they want.  
0: You didn't do it.  You poor fool, prepare for the worst possible outcome.
