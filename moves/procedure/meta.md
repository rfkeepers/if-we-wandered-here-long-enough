# Meta Reference

Meta moves walk though the framework for playing the game.  On one hand, you probably don't need these- especially if this isn't your first time at the PBtA rodeo.  The "moves" here are a serialization of common conventions within that system, and don't deviate in any special way.  Once you have them under your belt you probably won't need to come back and look anything up.

On the other hand, every now and then you may start asking, "did the author _really_ intend for us to run the game like this?"  When that happens, come back and look at these moves. Hopefully that answers your questions.

###### Have a Conversation

When you **sit down and play this game together**, all participants join in for a conversation about what happens, both in and out of (though primarily inside) the shared narrative space of the game.

The primary mode of play is to have a conversation.  Each participant, whether player, MC, or bystander, takes part in generating a fictional story by establishing a scene or situation in that fiction, or by having their characters react to those situations.  Traditionally, the MC sets up the moment and the players respond.  But it doesn't have to run that way.

There is no turn order, no time limit, and no requirements about when, how, or about what a participant should speak.  The only expectation is that you all:

1. Respect each other, your agreements, and your safety.
2. Approach playing this game with a common goal for tone and feel.
3. Stick to your Principles and Agendas, as described in the game.
4. Follow the rules whenever they apply.

###### Say What You Do

When you tell the MC or another player what you do, you do it.  If that doesn't trigger a move, then the MC may make a move as a consequence.

###### Follow the Flowchart

You don't have to follow this flowchart for _all sequences_ of play.  And you definitely should not think of this as "a phase of play we step into and out of".  Most of the time, play should flow naturally through the conversation.  That includes the pattern of spotlight switches, rules resolution, and the back and forth between the MC and players for moves and comments alike.

However, **whenever the scene has too much going on at once and it's getting difficult to track it all clearly**, refer to this flowchart to help guide the resolution of actions and moves.

1. The MC makes a move.  If an immediate response is needed, they'll set the spotlight on one or more PCs and ask, "what do you do?"
2. Players describe their response.  What does it look like when they act?
   What do they hope to accomplish?
  a. The player may state the move they're trying to make during this step.  The MC and other players may help guide their responses towards that move, or suggest alternative moves in its place.
3. Is a move triggered?
  a. Is a roll involved? If not, follow the move. If so, roll what the move says.
  b. What was the roll result? Follow what the move says happens. 
  c. Does the MC make a Move as a result? If so, they make their move now. 
4. Does anyone take Harm?
5. Does anyone Defy Consequences?
6. Does anyone Escalate the Situation? 
7. Return to the start.

###### Roll the Dice

When the rules tell you to Roll:

Did the rule say "Roll N dice"?  If so, roll that many dice.  Do not include any +1s, advantage, or disadvantage. 

Did the rule say "Roll _with something_"?  If so, start with 1 die (you always roll 1d, minimum) and add however many more that the move tells you to roll.  Add +1s, advantage, and disadvantage after.

Otherwise, start with 1 die (you always roll 1d, minimum), answer the following and take +1 for each "yes", then add +1s, advantage, and disadvantage.
  - Are you acting in accord with one of your approaches?
  - Do you have a boon (item, relationship, info, etc) that you're putting to use?

Roll the dice and count your hits.  The number of pips determines whether the die hits or misses. 1-4 misses. 5 and 6 hits.

Finally, return to the current Move and do what it tells you, depending on the results.  Most moves will bucket results into categories like 2+, 1, 0, which refers to the number of hits rolled.

###### Resolve Uncertainty

When the conversation stalls and the MC and players all look to each other with an uncertain shrug, the MC pauses the game and walks the table through the following steps.  You can stop and return to the game at any time.

1. Maybe take a quick break, especially if you've been playing for more than an hour straight.  Stretch, drink water, walk around, touch some grass.
2. Review your safety checks.  Is everyone feeling comfortable and safe?  If not, put the game to the side and talk about it.
3. Review the available moves.  Perhaps one of those will help move the scene forward.
4. Ask what's at stake in the current scene.  Perhaps you've stalled because the conversation has strayed away from what's important to the table.  If people aren't sufficiently invested, take a moment to point the conversation back in the right direction.
5. Ask what would be the most interesting place to go from here.  Does anyone have ideas they'd like to explore, or see explored?
6. If all else fails, pick one of the following:
  a. Follow the fiction: say what happens next, whatever makes sense in the fiction, and run with it.
  b. Turn to the universe for an answer: flip a coin, roll some dice, pull up a spark table; it doesn't particularly matter.  Find out what happens, and carry on.
