# Handling Consequences

These moves detail the procedures around taking Harm, Damage, or other consequences.  They belong to the procedure set because they focus on walking you through the process. None of the moves here generate new fiction on their own.

##### Take Harm

When you take Harm, answer the following questions in order.  Stop after you answer 'yes' to any question.

- Do you plan to save yourself from this Harm?  If so, check out **Defy Consequences**.
- Does the Harm inflict a Condition?  If so, mark the Condition, narrate how this moment has shaken you, then check whether you **Break Your Limits**.
- Do you want to protect yourself from Injury by taking a Condition instead?  If so, mark the Condition (your choice of which), then narrate how you avoided the Injury and why that moment shook you.  Finally, check whether you **Break Your Limits**.
- Does the Harm inflict an Injury?  Clarify the Injury tier with the MC (Pained, Wounded, Broken, or Fatal), check all of the following, and finally check whether this is a Fatal Injury.
  - Is that Injury tier already full?  If so, bump this Injury up to the next tier.
  - Does this bump up a tier from Broken to Fatal?  If so, immediately check Take a Fatal Injury.
  - Add the Injury to the first available slot, then narrate what it looks like when you take the blow.

###### Break Your Limits

When you mark a fifth condition, 
1. Mark Experience.
2. Use your playbook's **Limit Break**.
3. Erase four of your conditions.  Normally, this leaves you with 1.  If your Limit Break added another condition, you may have two or more afterward.

###### Take a Fatal Injury

When you take a Fatal Injury, choose one from below:
- **Take a lasting reminder**. You're out for the rest of the scene.  Describe a permanent impairment to your body (such as the loss of a limb or a hideous scar) that you'll be left to carry, forever.
- **Take an emotional scar**.  Pick one from the list of emotional scars below.  Add it to your list of approaches.  Playing up your emotional scar works like using any other approach.
- **Make a deal with an Entity**.  Death?  Your personal deity (or someone else's)?  The closest nearby resurrectionist office?  It doesn't matter who.  They'll bring you back to life, but only for the heaviest cost.  The MC will help you decide what that is.
- **Go out in a blaze of glory**. You Escalate the Situation. Describe your final, heroic, incredible act. Then you die.

If you're still alive, take an EXP.

List of Emotional Scars:
- (TODO: this list is a quick hack, very loosely inspired by blades trauma. Maybe the whole idea needs to get tossed.  I haven't decided yet.)
- Meek
- Haunted
- Volatile

###### Escalate the Situation

When a character Escalates the situation, the owning player (often the MC) narrates the escalation, including the introduction of new characters, obstacles, or environmental effects.  Escalations will significantly rearrange the position of all characters present in the scene.  Players should expect to readdress their situation afterward.

If any character is already in the middle of an action, the MC and players should find a way to weave those spotlights into the fiction such that their action ends before the Escalation (without rolling moves), or gets nullified by it. No character may interrupt, Defy, or otherwise cancel an escalation.
