# Rest Moves

These moves are about handling periods of rest, and the things that the party can do during that time. Periods of rest, whether long or short, should always break up the pace of your character's day. Likewise, we use them to break up the pace of play.

Unlike the other procedure moves, the Rest moves lean a bit more towards generating fiction by getting characters to engage with each other in specific ways.  Still, ultimately, they're all just ways to walk you through a couple routines.

It's also important to note that a couple of these moves (Refresh Yourself, Comfort and Care, and Doctor Injuries, among others) read like something that you can use in regular play, outside of periods of rest.  You can't do that.  This is the other reason these are in the procedure category.  You have to do the procedure to do the moves.


## Enjoy a Bonfire

When you all settle down for a rest (overnight, an afternoon, the weekend, etc) to recover, eat, sleep, talk, and so on, first Refresh Yourself, then every  player chooses one from the following list:
- Start (or eavesdrop on) a Conversation: who is involved?  Where is it taking place?  Invite some characters to the scene and play it out.  Moves my trigger as needed.
- **Doctor Injuries** or **Comfort and Care** with another player.  Either you can treat them, or you can request that they treat you.
- Find a quiet corner to **Repair Damage**, work on a crafting project, or **Research the World**.
- Engage in a **Ritual**, either by yourself or with others.
- Prepare (or organize) a meal.  Everyone who joins you to enjoy the food gets to ask one question from **Read the Room**.  Questions about reading people may be directed at anyone else attending the meal.  Whenever possible, players (not the MC) should answer for their characters.

Any active Dooms and Ecosystems continue to move forward through this time, hatching and enacting schemes or continuing their momentum. Each player makes an Ecosystem move.  The MC makes a Doom move.

If the MC has any reason to interrupt your rest it will happen after all the options are chosen.  Expect questions about who is doing what when the interruption occurs.


## Refresh Yourself

When you spend some uninterrupted time tending to yourself and your equipment (such as when you Enjoy a Bonfire or Take a Long Break), do all of the following:

1 - Clear any Pains.
2 - Refresh any used Armor.
3 - Discard any expired or consumed resources.
4 - Regain all of your Defiances.


## Doctor Injuries

When you find some time and safety to patch up a character's Injuries, expend the appropriate supplies (bandages, stitching, poultices, potions, reagents, etc), then pick one of the following conversation topics to pass the time while you do your work.  Whether or not that character answers you, they drop all their Wounds to Pains, and any Injury to a Wound.

- How could I get you to ________?
- What are your feelings concerning ________?
- What do you want right now?
- Do you think it was right of us to ________?
- Let me tell you something you don't know about me.


## Comfort and Care

When you find some time and safety to have a vulnerable, supportive, or caring moment together with another character, each of you picks one of your marked Conditions (if you have one) and puts it at stake.  Then, each of you picks one of the following questions and asks:

- How do you think I could have done better?
- Will you tell me something you still respect/admire/love about me, despite this flaw?
- I don't need you to say anything, but could you give me a sign of affection or support to get my mind off of it? (Play a game together, some friendly sparring, take a casual stroll, tell me a story, etc)

If their answer gave you what you needed (be honest), erase your condition.  If not, keep it or swap it out for a different one.


## Repair Damage

When you take some time and safety to yourself to repair your damaged Resources, pick the resource you want to repair, expend the appropriate supplies, and get to work. Pick one of the following and tell the table about it, then clear any damage from that Resource.

- What thought keeps running through your head?
- Pick a character- PC or NPC- say what you think about them right now.
- Spin a yarn about something in your past, whatever it is you're reflecting back upon right now.


## Take a Long Break

When you all take an extended break or put your adventure on hiatus (days, weeks, months, or more), first Refresh Yourself, then tell everyone what you've been up to.  Once you're caught up with each other, start preparing for your next adventure.  Make the following purchase as a group (wealth is always shared across all characters); the benefits of each choice are given to all characters.  Individual moves that replace wealth are usable here.

Spend Wealth 1-1 to do the following:
- Restock: Clear out all your marked supply.  Set a new supply type for each box (up to the maximum you can carry).
- Hire an NPC: a guide, guard, caretaker, or follower.
- (TODO: could use a few more.)

Design note; I'd like to hook reputation changes into this a bit, but I'm not sure how yet.
