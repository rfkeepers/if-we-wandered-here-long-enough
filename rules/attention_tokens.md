# Attention Tokens

Attention tokens are a meta-game for engaging the players in spaces and ways that is simply difficult to do diegetically or in a freeform manner.

This system is _very experimental_.  Though I've also injected it into other games and it's been pretty successful.

## Getting and spending tokens

At the beginning of every session, the MC gives every player at the table 1 token.  Players may spend their token at any time (in or out of scene, play, during breaks, etc) for one of the effects listed below.  "Spending a token" always means handing it over to the MC.

When all tokens are spent, the MC hands them out again: one per player.

Any player who spends at least 2 tokens during the session gains 1 EXP at the end of the session.  Tables with large groups or short playtimes may reduce this as necessary (ex: gaining exp only requires all players to spend a token at least once).

At the end of the session, all tokens are collected by the MC.  Unspent tokens have no effect.

## Attention vs Safety Tools

A note on Attention Tokens versus Safety Tools: spending attention tokens _never_ takes priority over safety tools.  Nor does using a safety tool ever require a token.  

On the surface, there's a thin line between spending a token to (for example) **Ask For Less** to say "I'd rather my character make an exit" compared to the _Open Door Policy_.  Spending attention assumes that everyone feels safe and comfortable, and that the player has spent their token because they either think it makes for an interesting turn in the fiction, or because they simply want to be moved out of the scene.  IE: this is a tool to further engage with the fiction and where you're taking it.

Similar to Safety Tools, no one at the table may require a player to justify spending their token. There is no provision like "you can only spend a token if you provide a satisfactory explanation".  The expenditure is sufficient.

In the event that two players have contradicting wants: such as one player asking for more and another player asking for less, both for the same thing, consider the following:

1. Did the ask for more infringe on safety, whether established or in the moment? If one player is asking for more, and that impacts another player's sense of safety, then safety wins. Do not spend any tokens. Pause play and talk with each other about what is wanted in this moment. Resume play when all players are satisfied with addressing what they want to see, or not.
2. Is the second token an attempt to overturn the first token? Players are always allowed to add complication to a scene by spending tokens, but they shouldn't be trying to counteract each other. Pause play and talk it through as necessary. Make sure the conflict isn't based on safety or other unhappiness with how play has transpired.  If there are no problems and the players are simply trying to game the system, return the token to the second player (the countering player) and move ahead with only the effects of the first spend.

## Using attention

### Ask for more

When a player wants the MC (or another player) to dig deeper into the current moment, they can spend a token and tell that person what they're after. Pause play as needed to talk about it.

"More" should be loosely interpreted.  It can mean, "I'd like to see more of that tone/topic/detail as we continue playing".  Or, "I'm really into this and I want to see more of it right now."  Or, "This particular thing really interests me, can we dig in to the details?"

It can also be used to ask for clarification.  Such as, "I don't understand this" or "I'm a bit lost, help me catch up".

Finally, you can use it to ask for more of your character.  "I'd like to take part in this moment, how can we bring my character into the scene?" or "I'd like to show something off about my character, but I need help doing that, can I get assistance?"

The only thing "More" is not allowed to provide is in-game mechanics (resources, wealth, harm, etc). This is a meta currency, and its uses are restricted to match.

### Ask for less

When a player wants the MC (or another player) to step back from the current moment, they can spend a token and tell the table what they want to avoid. Pause play and talk about what needs to get dropped.  If necessary, update your safety tools such as Lines and Veils.

"Less" should be loosely interpreted.  It can mean, "I'd like to see less of that tone/topic/detail as we continue playing".  Or, "I'm not into this right now, or it's bothering me, and I'd like us to move past it."  Or, "I'm fine with this, but we should pull back on the level of detail".

You can also use it to ask for less of your character.  "I'd rather not be here in this moment, how can my character make an exit?" or "I'd like to keep that part of my character from being exposed right now, can we shift our attention elsewhere?"

The only thing "Less" is not allowed to restrict is in-game mechanics (harm, conditions, cost, etc).  This is a meta currency, and its uses are restricted to match.

### Add an Ingredient

If a player wants to add a dash of seasoning into the scene, they can add an ingredient.  What counts as an ingredient?  It's anything that adds color, texture, or flavor.

Atmospheric effects and sensory details ("a heavy rainstorm has blanketed the town", "the wind here smells like butterscotch and harpy nests").  Architectural or environmental setpieces ("there's a fountain it the courtyard that constantly spews fire, but it has a magical binding to make it feel cold instead of hot").  Things to interact with are also welcome ("there's a berry bush near camp full of those white strawberries that taste like pineapples... also they're hallucinogenic")

The only hard rule is that the ingredient can't solve a problem or provide a resource.  These are flavorings, not utensils.

Adding ingredients can feel a lot like painting the scene, except that the player volunteered themselves to do a bit of painting.  It gives them an outlet and reward for pursuing their enthusiasm.

If your table feels comfortable with this mechanic, the players can spend their token to add main ingredients: characters, monsters, obstacles, and so on. Let them start traps and prescribe hazards, inject villains and _Suddenly Ogres!_  Let them ramp up their own tension.

### Celebrate a moment

Sometimes you just need to toss a coin to your fellow player.

The gesture itself is all that matters here.  It's a way of showing your appreciation.  "I like how you handled that moment", or "that was a really awesome description", or "I'm super into what you're doing right now".  Or even a simple, "thank you".

You don't need to interrupt play or explain yourself in the moment. Celebrations can be done in silence, though you still probably want to make the act seen.
