# Resources

Resources track all the "things" that your character gathers through their time out adventuring. The loot, obviously.  The tools they make or find or bring along. Even intangibles can be resources: promises, reputations, knowledge, preparations, and so on.

What separates a Resource from all the other things and concepts in the world?  It's very simple: you write Resources down on your character sheet.  Really, that's all it is.  Anything can be, and not be, a Resource.

Each resource counts for three things:
1. As something that can be used to add a die when you _roll it_.
2. As a thing that you can utilize in the fiction, just by having it.
3. As a reminder of the tokens and memories you carry around with you, and to whom they might be important.

The other important part about Resources is that you don't have to write down _everything_.  If it's established that your character has a thing, then you have that thing.  You don't need to write down a resource to prove it.  Having a resources should feel a little bit special.  Even when they're mundane, then they must be very useful or provide specific value.

A good example to think about is a plain old walking stick. Mundane? Very. Useful? Practically speaking, sure. Could you talk about using it in the fiction? You sure can; it might even be a key factor to your success, in the right environment. But is it a _Resource_? Probably not. It's just a stick, even when it's a durable and dependable one.

## Damage

Damage is one of the many consequences that can befall your character during their adventures.  Damage, specifically, is a lot like Harm.  It means something bad happened directly to your character.  Or, more precisely, to your character's stuff.

Players should assume that any move which can Harm your character can also Damage your Resources.  Most of the time the text won't bother to say both to save some breath.

## Making Resources

All Resources should be described by the properties listed below.  You don't need to fill out every part for every resource.  Many Resources include blank or ignored sections.  A blank section means that there's no mechanical requirement to follow.

The statements you write down in each section are primarily prescriptive- they create a contract of use as part of leveraging that Resource- but that doesn't stop you from using their descriptive elements as well.  These things are real, after all, and can be put into the fiction however you need.

### Name

The one thing every resource must have is a name. Ie: what is it?  A potion?  A ritual lantern?  The marquis de rosefitz's signet ring?  Whatever you say it is, that's what it is.

### Special Benefits

Some Resources have mechanically specific uses or benefits.  Armor, Saves, and potions are all good examples.  These things will describe exactly what they can be used for.

Generally, when a resource has a special use, you wouldn't also use it to get a die when you _roll it_. The rules have already given that thing a specific use. This isn't a hard rule; use your best judgement.

### Tags

Resources can be tagged with various properties. Use the tags listed in these rules, or add whatever feels right.  These tags represent some peculiar, innate aspect of the resource.  You only need to add them if it's special for the resource to embody that aspect.

### Uses

If the Resource has limited uses (usually stated like, "Three uses") then every time you use its special benefit, use it for a die when rolling, or leverage it for specific benefit in the fiction, you have to mark off one of the uses. At 0 remaining uses it gets destroyed or becomes unusable.

### Refresh

A Refresh describes how you can refill the uses for a Resource. That means it can drop to 0 uses without getting destroyed. If no refresh is listed, then the Resource must get destroyed after it's all used up.

Resources may reference other mechanics such as moves (ex: on rest), frames of time and play (ex: start of the session, end of the scene), or fictional events (ex: when submerged in clean water).

### Durability

Durability describes how much Damage a resource can take before it gets destroyed.  If a resource doesn't have any durability it'll get destroyed after taking any damage.  Each point of damage gets marked on the sheet.  When the tally of damage matches the durability, the Resource gets destroyed.

Damage can be repaired by a rest move.

Some Resources may claim `Invulnerable`.  This means the resource is impervious to damage.  It can only be destroyed or made unusable if it runs out of uses and cannot refresh.

### Expiration

Not all Resources last forever.  They may only be good for a limited time, or while some other effect is in place.  If an Expiration is listed then the Resource can only be used up to its expiration.  Use it or lose it.

### Worth

Some Resources, the particularly tangible ones, may be worth a bit of coin in trade.  Worth marks their equivalent wealth, one-for-one. If the Resource has no worth, then either it can't be sold, or no one would pay more for it than pocket change. That doesn't mean its worthless; the MC may always provide you with an especially interested buyer, or allow you to trade the thing in to satisfy a debt.

Each point of damage knocks down the Worth by 1.  Ex, if a Resource has `Worth: 2`, and `Damage: 1`, then its Worth is currently `1`.  Expending uses may also reduce the Worth.  Or, alternatively, uses can be sold off at smaller Worth.  The MC will help you adjust the Worth of the item to match the fiction.

## Resources and Moves

A Resource isn't a move in itself. But you may wonder: can a Resource _provide_ a move?  Sure!

If you want to do that, you can add the move as the _Special Benefit_ of the Resource.  The move still triggers like any move would, but it must also follow the other constraints that are written into the resource.  IE: it can have special refreshes, take damage, expire, have tags, and etc.

## Supply

It's natural to assume that every character carries around some amount of gear, tools, sundry goods, rations, and etc at all times.  After all, you can't go on an adventure without provisions.

This game isn't particularly interested in tracking the survivalist aspects of that journey. The characters are expected to have sufficient food and drink at all times (if the MC wants to put pressure on those conditions, other systems are available, such as group Burdens).

All of the other "stuff" that a character carries around gets abstracted into the _Supply_ system.  Supplies represent the potential Resources that each character might be able to pull out and use.  Supplies transform into concrete resources when you **Produce a Resource**.

Supplies, like all Resources, should be a little bit special.  You shouldn't reach for your supplies for common or mundane items like knives, pots and pans, salt, waterskins, etc.  You can just have those (though, depending on the situation, the MC might make you go through the effort of pulling them out of your pack). Reserve supplies for when the Resource is both something you don't carry on hand at all times, and helps you overcome an obstacle or danger.

Player characters carry around a maximum of 6 supply by default. Supply only refreshes if the characters find or buy more supply in the fiction, usually by **Taking a Long Break**.

Each Supply carried by a player has to list its type. Characters can only produce Resources that would match that type of supply.  Eg: _Crafting (Poisons)_ supplies are a decent type if you want some soothing herbs. _Medical_ supplies could reasonably be used es well. But it's unlikely that you'll find these herbs in _Research_ or _Adventuring_ supplies.

Ex:

> 1. Crafting (Laceweaving)
> 2. Crafting (Laceweaving)
> 3. Crafting (Laceweaving)
> 4. Research (Monsters)
> 5. Adventuring
> 6. Adventuring

Some Conditions will force you to consume 2 supplies to produce a single Resource.  When this happens, the supply types don't have to match each other.  Say which supply is the one you're producing, then strike out one more supply of your choosing.

## Common Supply Types

- **Adventuring**: torches, blankets, flint & steel, spyglass, rope, chalk, etc.
- **Cooking**: rare spices, potent snacks, refined oils, magical stoves, water purifiers, etc.
- **Crafting (type)**: anything that helps produce, aid, or refine that craft.
- **Hunting**: nets, tripwires, a small cage, collars, bait, camouflage, etc.
- **Medical**: bandages, poultices, potions, sanitizing spirits, needle & thread, etc.
- **Research (topic)**: books, maps, references, guides, advice, or etc about the topic.
- **Shady**: lockpicks, mirrors, grappling hook, disguises, crowbars, explosives, etc.

side thought: tier of item.  Higher tiers cost more to gain.
