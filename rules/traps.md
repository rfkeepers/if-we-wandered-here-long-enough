# Traps

These aren't your standard spike pits and poison darts.  They're clocks!

No, really, this is the section on clocks.  Which are called `Traps` in this game.

## ~Clock~ Trap rules

A Trap is a countdown until something happens.  That thing could be good or bad, big or small, abstract or concrete.  Doesn't really matter.  What matters is when the Trap gets sprung.  Traps get represented by a pool of four-sided dice that eventually diminishes to 0, at which point the trap springs.

In general, they're good for representing two different events: 1/ something will inevitably happen, but when? (the guards arrive, the marquis departs, the sun rises), 2/ if we keep doing this, it's going to result in something, (our presence is discovered, our cover gets blown, we rally the town behind us).

The MC may roll to check a Trap anytime it fits (most often as a move or consequence of a move). Checking a Trap doesn't necessarily mean something literally changed in the fiction.  Especially when the Trap represents something happening far away, in the background, abstract, or otherwise outside of the PC's view. It's fine to keep it abstract until the end.

When a Trap gets checked, the MC rolls the current number of dice in the pool.  If a die comes up with any number besides 4, it gets removed.

For example: the MC checks a trap with 3 remaining dice.  They roll `[1,4,3]`.  The 4 stays, the other two dice drop, and the Trap is now reduced to 1 remaining die.

## Setting up a Trap

Traps may be created at any time, for any reason. They don't require prior moves or consequences. They're a social contract more than anything.  A statement that _something is going to happen_, but also, _we don't know when_.

Every Trap starts with between 4 and 8 dice, depending on how long it should take before the thing happens (the expected number of checks is roughly the same as the number of dice at the start).

To set up a new Trap, write down what happens when it springs and how many dice are in the pool. That's it. Don't roll the dice just yet. Save that for when something changes.
