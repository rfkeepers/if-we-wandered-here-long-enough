# Debts

Debts are a relationship management system for tracking who you owe and who owes you.  They're kind of like bonds, except to represent obligations instead of connections.

Having a debt means that the person you're indebted to might come calling one day.  It doesn't signify anything more than that.  In general, only the character holding the debt will keep record of it. So the MC will keep track of which NPCs hold a debt on a PC, and the Players will keep track of the NPCs who owe them a debt.

Gaining a debt requires either a Move (some moves will tell you to gain or take on a debt), or a formal agreement with the MC.  They're not something you can write down on your own.
