# Rolling

What to roll, when to roll, and how to evaluate the outcomes.


## Roll It

"Roll it" is the most common call for a roll that you'll see in the game.  It means, "follow the normal rolling procedure with no changes to the rules".


## Roll With...

"Roll with" means you need to roll, but you should ditch the normal rules and use the "with" to know how many dice to roll.  The move in question (or, sometimes, the playbook on the whole) should make it clear what that quantity is.

For example, "Roll with yesses" implies there were a series of questions to answer as part of the move, and you should take an additional die for each question where you answered "yes".


## Roll N dice

Means "Roll exactly that many dice".  For example, "Roll with 2 dice" means exactly what it says: you roll 2 dice.  You'll most frequently see 2 dice listed here.  That's roughly the same as a 2d6+Nothing in standard pbta.


## Other vocabulary

**Die**: A six-sided die.  No other die sizes are used.  

**+1**: add one additional die to the roll.  
**-1**: remove one die from the roll.  

**Hit**: A successful result on a die.  
**On a Hit**: do this if any number of dice Hit.  
**On every Hit**: do this for every die that Hits.
**Miss**: An unsuccessful result on a die.  
**On a Miss**: do this if any number of dice Miss.  
**On every Miss**: do this for every die that Misses.  

**Advantage (adv)**: Add 1 Hit to the roll results.  
**Disadvantage (dis)**: Remove 1 Hit from the roll results, if any occurred.  

**2+**: Any roll outcome where two or more dice hit.  
**1**: Any roll outcome where only one die hits.  
**1-**: Any roll outcome where only one, or zero, dice hit.  
**0**: Any roll outcome where no dice hit.  


## On adjusting for difficulty

If the first question anyone asks is, "how do I roll," then the second question is, "how do I adjust for difficulty?"  The shortest answer is: you don't.

There should be no +/-1 handed out as reward for tactics.  No advantage or disadvantage for good or bad positioning.  The roll is always the roll and nothing more.

This rule is especially important within this game, where so much negotiation about the consequences for danger and uncertainty get handled in the conversation and not with rolls.  What matters most is the decision that an opportunity to roll exists.  That is: the character can do it (sometimes they shouldn't be allowed to roll in the first place), and it isn't easy (sometimes the outcome is such a given that there's no need to roll).
