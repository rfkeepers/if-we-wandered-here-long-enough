# NPCs

Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) are any character (person, creature, monster, automaton, etc) that isn't controlled by one of the players.  They are, by default, played by the MC.

NPCs do not use most of the systems that Player Characters (PCs) do.  They don't track Harm (though they can be harmed), have no Defiance or Approaches (they don't roll at all, for that matter), and their Resources are a lot lighter on detail.

## Generating NPCs

Generating an NPC should be straight-forward.  Every NPC must have the following:

- **Name**: ex. Old Crodwell, The Marquis de Rosefitz, Gelatinous Ooze
- **Description**: A short statement about their appearance and purpose.
- **Drive**: Their impulse, goal, or desire.
- **Resources**: A list of the things that safeguard and support them.  More on this below.

Human NPCs may also have:

- **Pressures**: What methods of pressure are likely to work if the players **Pressure Them**.

Notable NPCs (especially those that the players want to defeat) may also have:

- **Escalations**: Special reactions that the NPC takes in response to having their resources removed.

## Harming NPCs

Unlike player-characters (PCs), Non-Player-Characters (NPCs) don't track a tally of Harms.  They have no "health pool" or "clock" representing the amount of damage they can take.  They don't fall over when you punch them for the nth time.

That doesn't mean you can't _harm them_ (little-h harm, here).  You can put them in a mood (anger, sadness, fear, etc), though that's not the same as a condition.  You can give them injuries (break their nose, cut of their sword arm, etc).  All these effects and their consequences get tracked in the fiction.  They play out in the conversation.  But they aren't necessarily getting you closer to _defeating_ the NPC.

## NPC Resources

NPC resources work very differently from PC resources.  They're not so complicated; just a simple list of things that the NPC has at their disposal: items, allies, innate abilities, strong ideas, etc.

These resources comprise the single mechanic on which conflict resolution (I hesitate to use the word "combat", but it applies) between PCs and NPCs pivots.

In the most reductive take, resources are akin to an NPCs "health" or "defeat clock". The big difference here is that health and clock are "count up" abstractions.  The players keep adding something to the NPC (damage, ticks, conditions, etc) to make a counter max out, and then the NPC goes away.  That's the reverse of how resources works.

Any resource that provides effective and present means of protection is sufficient to keep that NPC safe.  And will continue to do so for as long as that resource is valid.

"Effective" means that the resource needs to actually have a way to provide protection.  Not all resources act as a means of protection (they can also represent wealth, influence, information and opportunities).  Likewise, being protective doesn't mean it saves against all kinds of Harm: shields rarely block insults, and self-esteem is notoriously weak against crossbows.

"Present" means that the resource need to be here in the scene.  The resource "enough gold to hire an army" means the gold is present, but not the army.  An NPC with an "unbreakable shield" can only block attacks while holding the shield.

If the players are trying to defeat (or significantly push) an NPC, that NPC will utilize their resources to resist or defend themselves. That's not descriptive, it's prescriptive.  The players cannot overcome an NPC so long as any of their resources could prevent the act.  By extent, this also means that players can't use any move that would sidestep this convention.

So how do you get rid of a resource? This game has no "fight" move, nor does any move list "remove an NPC's resource" as one of its options.  To do it, you do it. Describe the act in the fiction and follow it through.  The core moves are all tailored to the process of doing it.

Let's take an example:

```
Centipede Dragon
---
A mountain-dwelling giant with a hundred spiny legs and stony carapace.

Drive: Hunt the goats that venture up the higher slopes.

Resources:
- Barbels that detect the tremors of any nearby footstep.
- A prehensile tail ending in a barbed pincer able to snatch players in its grasp.
- Chitinous plating that deflects blows from weaponry.

Escalations:
- Thrash about violently.
- Barf forth digestive goop.
```

The players want to hunt a Centipede Dragon, do they? Here's what to expect: any attempt to approach the creature puts it on guard (barbels).  If a player gets close enough the dragon will snap them up with its tail and fling them away (barbed pincer).  Even when they manage to get past the tail, they'll somehow have to get through the creature's chitin.

Barbels can be sliced off (though again, there's that tail). An easier approach might be to confuse the beast: cause a stampede to hide the player's footsteps, or find some way to approach by air.  The tail isn't getting cut off anytime soon (that chitin), but it could get bound up in a trap or caught under a rockfall.  Finally, the chitin. Perhaps you could crack through it with mining equipment. Or, if you can paralyse the dragon, you could take some time to feel out the gaps between the plates and slice them out.

Every resource must be an obstacle that the players can tackle. Things that cannot be changed, removed, or thwarted shouldn't be resources.  Other characters can be resources.  Moves can be resources (so long as the trigger is something the players can remove).  Most ideas are fair game.

There's no official power scaling between NPCs.  The closest approximation is somewhere in the middle of how many resources they have, how fictionally difficult it would be to remove them, and what those resources are capable of doing.

As an example to contrast difficulty, here's two NPCs each with two resources.
- `Ben, the farmer.  A weathered spade. Grizzled and obstinate mule named Gob.`
- `Nyyt, empress. Elite personal guard. Denizens treat her commands as new law.`

## Escalations

Escalations are a special kind of resource that only NPCs access (side note, certain PC moves require Escalation as a consequence, but no PC has an Escalation move directly).  In short, they're a one-time-use move to completely reset everyone's position in the current scene.

Only one Escalation can be tapped in any move by the MC. This means some Escalations could be lost if they aren't used in time. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Nothing requires you to use every Escalation first, nor to use them as quickly as possible.  They're here for narrative pacing as much as mechanics.

The MC should tap an Escalation in one of three scenarios:
1. The NPC has just lost one of their resources and is wants to reclaim a sense of control and safety.
2. The NPC has lost all of their Resources and is about to be defeated, but has one or more Escalations untapped.
3. The NPC has lost at least one Resource, and the PCs are causing some significant trouble or danger that they need to escape or dominate.

Escalations must always reset the situation, regardless of how weak, strong, or specific they read.  For example, `Flee to safety` means the NPC does exactly that: they flee the scene, and find safety.  Can the PCs stop them?  Not in the middle of the Escalation. The player cannot say, "I see the Marquis turning to run, and trip him before he gets very far".  Escalations cannot be defied or saved against. Any counters have to be proactive.  If the Marquis is already bound by hand and foot, they'll have a difficult time tapping that Escalation to begin with.

If an NPC escapes the situation alive (whether defeated or not), they may recover tapped Escalations for the next run in.  Or they may not.  No mechanic exists for recovering or replacing Escalations. If you feel like some mechanics would help, I suggest leaning on other systems in the game: trap pools and ecology moves, in particular.

### Defeating NPCs

It takes two steps to defeat an NPC.  First, you have to get rid of the _Resources_ that they use for protection.  Second, you have to **Defeat An Adversary**.  How do you do that?  Well, through the fiction, of course.

Once you separate an NPC from the resources that protect them, it's only a matter of dealing the final blow.  There's no procedure to explain here.  When you do it, you do it.

### Mooks

When it comes to NPCs as walking, talking, sometimes-sword-swinging obstacles standing between your characters and their next objective, some of them are what you'd call a "mook".  A nobody.  They're as much terrain as individual.

On one hand, plugging mooks into the story isn't a recommendation.  At least, don't use mooks for characters you want to spend meaningful time around.  On the other hand, background characters do serve a purpose.  And sometimes it sets the scene to have filler characters.

The rule for defeating mooks is simple: they don't have resources.  You should skip straight to their defeat.
