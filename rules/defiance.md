# Defiance and Saves

Defiance (aka, the move **Defy Consequences**) and Saves are a system for Players to directly negate damage and Harm to their characters by narrating new outcomes wherein the character narrowly escapes or brazenly overcomes punishment.

The system is designed for framing heroic stands. "How badass would it be if I turned their blade aside at the last second; they may be better with the sword, but my face shows a cold and calculating refusal to submit." Or, "I raise my head high; the king's words may cut deep, but I know their treachery and I will not let this tyrant reach my heart."

It's also about giving the MC freedom to go harder with their moves.  This game expects the table to leverage conversation more than rolls, and that requires the MC to put pressure on the Players by endangering and hurting them, even before a Player makes a roll.  In response, the Players may Defy the MC, taking back control in that moment.

It is not about managing mechanical attrition ("I'm down to my last two saves, perhaps we should go back to camp and rest before venturing deeper"), though the players are likely to consider saves as part of those decisions.  Nor is it about negotiating fictional accuracy ("I really don't think the archer could have reloaded their crossbow that quickly"); you can have that debate without turning to this mechanic.

You'll know your table has hit the right stride when you see a scene unfold like this:

> The MC makes a move with a hard consequence- "the knight swings their enormous mace, smashing you aside: take a Wound"- and the affected Player says, "ok, sure".
>
> They try to disarm the knight, roll 0, and watch their own sword snap under the strain.  "You can defy that," the MC may remind them.  The player responds, "Nah, this is good stuff.
>
> The MC follows with another hard move: "the knight raises their mace like a judge's gavel and shouts, "none may defy the king!", before bringing it down on your head.  Take an injury.
>
> The player rebuts, "Heh, nope, I defy that, with Force.  I catch the mace in my hands and shout, 'Fool! I am the true king!'"


## How to Do It

The procedure is straightforward

First, the MC says, "this bad thing happens to the character".  This may come up in the conversation, or it may be the direct result of a move.

Then the player says, "no, I want to **Defy the Consequences**."  The player spends an appropriate Save, narrates how they overcame or avoided that consequence, and then play continues.


### Consequence vs Fiction

The most important rule to understand is that defiance works on the _Consequences_ of the fiction, not the fiction itself.  Players may avoid or overcome the punishment coming your way, but they cannot remove the original danger or problem entirely.

Let's run an example. The MC tells you- the player- "the ogre attacks, knocking you off the bridge and into the icy waters below; take a Wound".  This statement establishes three important things: 1/ you were attacked by an ogre (a fictional truth), 2/ it wounded you (a consequence), 3/ it knocked you off the bridge (another consequence).

- You could defy the Wound, but get knocked into the water: "I instinctively raise my shield, just in time to keep the club from shattering my bones. (Intuit)"
- Or you can take the Wound while you defy getting knocked off the bridge: "I let the club strike me in the chest so that I can wrap my arms around the weapon, holding fast to it instead of getting knocked back. (Force)"
- Defiance is adaptable to what save and narration you attach to it, making it possible to defy both consequences at the same time: "Ogres are slow and easy to predict, I crouch low and the attack sails over my head. (Skill)"

But you cannot defy that the ogre attacked you in the first place.  That much is fictional truth.  You only have the capacity to save yourself from the punishment.


## Saves

Saves quantify how many times each character can save, and how they're allowed to do it.  Anytime a player Defies a Consequence they must spend an appropriate Save.

"Appropriate" use of a save will sometimes be defined by the Save itself (ex: Save by parrying a weapon with your shield).  Other times, when the Save isn't well defined, it's up to the MC to decide.

Saves appear in two forms: Save Resources and Defiances.


### Save Resources

Save Resources are a classification of resources that give the player a specific way to save against a consequence.  Like all resources, only PCs get these, never NPCs.

Save resources can be earned many different ways: through moves, as a benefit of certain equipment (such as Armor), or by procuring a resource in the fiction.  Once used, they either get removed from the character's resources

Every Save Resource has four properties: the Save, the Use Count, the Refresh, and the Loss.  These will all be short statements that lay out the rules around the resource.

`The Save` prescribes how this resource can be leveraged.  For example, Medium Armor states "Save against Pain". Therefore, when the MC tells a player, "take a Pain", the player can say, "I defy that Pain with my armor".

Each Save Resource can only be used as many times as is listed on its `Use Count` before it is lost or needs to be refreshed.  It's very rare for a Save Resource to have more than one use, so this detail is normally omitted.  If you don't see a Use Count specified, assume it's a single-use item.

Once a save is used up, `The Refresh` prescribes what needs to happen before this resource can be used again.  This may reference another move (ex: Medium Armor refreshes with **Refresh Yourself**), or it may require a specific action or event (ex: "Refresh when you worship your deity.").

Not all Save Resources will specify a Refresh; those ones will have a `Loss` condition instead.  Loss prescribes how you permanently lose access to this resource.  "Lose this on use" is the most common Loss.  It means that you only get it so long as you have some uses remaining.  Once used, the resource should be discarded.  If no Loss is stated, you can still lose the resource in the fiction.  Any resource can get destroyed, dropped, taken, or locked away; saves are no exception.

#### Examples

> **Medium Armor** - Save against Pain.  One use.  Refresh when you **Refresh Yourself**.

> **The King's Protection** - Save against getting denied or detained by the city guard. Two uses before your word alone starts to wear thin. Refresh by revealing corruption or misdeeds to the Guard-Captain.

> **Enchantment: Mirror-Encased Mind** - Save against the sight of the eldritch god's rotted visage.  Lose this after you meet their gaze; even a warded mind can only withstand so much.

### Defiances

Each PC has access to four defiances: Force, Skill, Charm, and Intuition.  AKA, their `Defiances`.  These values, much like traditional stats, are represented by a number.  Between 0 and 3, in this case.  Unlike in other games they don't describe the character's _prowess_, but instead, their capacity for defiance.

Each defiance is like a shorthand version of a Save Resource.  If they were written out in full it would look something like this:

> **<Defiance>** - Save with a <defiance-like> action.  <defiance-#> uses.  Refresh when you **Refresh Yourself**.

Defiances are intentionally broad terms.  They showcase what adversities and dangers a character is able to overcome and, likewise, what ones they cannot. When calling on a defiance it's most important for the PC to show a fictionally consistent quality of themselves.

Enforcing the defiance name or description exactly as written or defined (eg: "is that really intuition?  It feels more like charm.") is not a goal of the system.  Let the names and descriptions guide you towards a fitting narration, and then release their constraint.

- **Force**: by overpowering, pushing aside, or proving it insufficient.
- **Skill**: by nimbly evading, underhanded tactics, or showcasing exceptional capability or expertise.
- **Charm**: by social influence, charms, seduction, or performance.
- **Intuition**: by anticipation, preparation, emotional connection, or accurate guesswork.

Each PC starts with two points that can be allocated to their Defiances however they want.  These values can be increased, but only by leveling up.  PCs are much more likely to gain saves through resources than through increasing Defiance.
