# Harm

Lots of bad consequences will befall your characters.  You'll get put in danger and find yourselves in a lousy spot; your stuff can get lost, taken, or damaged; you can be separated from each other, or gain the attention of your enemies.  All nasty business.  But none of it is _Harm_.

Harm is a very specific kind of consequence: the kind you write on your character sheet.  It's the accumulation of your physical, mental, and emotional wear and tear.  Also, the ways that those things affect you.

Harm is split into three primary categories: Conditions (emotional and mental problems), Injuries (bodily problems), and Burdens (situational problems; usually affecting the group).

## Injuries

Injuries form the "bodily" portion of Harm management.  Cuts, bruises, and broken bones, sure.  But also headaches, lack of sleep, and fevers.

Injuries are separated into three escalating tiers: Pains, Wounds, and getting Broken.  Pains are superficial and quick to heal or get treated (headaches, sprains, minor cuts and scrapes).  Wounds are serious, but not life-threatening (stabbed, poisoned, shot, concussed).  Getting Broken puts your life on the line.

In some other games, label- and description-based harm systems are a way to engage with the wide and varied realities of physical damage.  After all, human bodies are ultimately frail (especially when compared to fantasy monstrosities), and recovery is a long process- when it works at all. So I want to be clear: none of that is intended for this game.

The goal of this design is to maintain- and manage- a sense of threat and danger, and to make players choose how to avoid making it worse. There are a number of systems that let you avoid an injury: armor, defiance, or taking a Condition instead (see **Take Harm** in the harm moves).  It wants characters to trade those resources to avoid a bit of Harm.  It wants the MC to hit hard, and hit often, to force those trades.

Beyond that, the harsh realities of bodily injury and healing can fade into the background.  Not because they aren't interesting.  Only because there are other, more interesting things for you to do.

### Injury Tiers

Each injury tier has a maximum number of slots.  Once those are filled up you have to start taking more severe injuries in place of less severe ones.  Explicitly, if you can't take another Pain, then it becomes a Wound.  If you can't do that, then it Breaks you.  If you're already broken, you **Take a Fatal Injury**.

2 Pains
- removed when **Refreshing Yourself**.

2 Wounds
- downgrades to Pain when you **Doctor Injuries**.

1 Break
- You require the aid of another character to do anything.
- Treatment drops to wound.

When dealing Harm the MC my inflict any severity of Injury that is appropriate to the fiction. As a result, the MC can also deal a Fatal blow as wanted.  That's just as important for downgrading as it is for upgrading the perceived danger. Nothing in this game is required to cause a certain severity of injury. It's all a way to dial in the suspense.


### Armor, Shields and other Equipment

Armor is always considered as a single item.  You're either armored (Medium or Heavy) or you aren't.  Separate pieces of wear (chest, legs, etc) are not individually tracked.  Specifics about the benefits of armor are described in the [[rules/resources.md]] and [[rules/defiance.md]] sections.

Shields have no inherent mechanical bonus (saves, dice, etc).  They only provide fictional presence. Characters holding a shield can take actions that other characters couldn't have attempted.  That's the real power of a shield.

All other equipment follows the same rule.  Having it is exactly as useful as it sounds.  There's no further attempt to abstract the benefits into a mechanical form.

## Conditions

A Condition is some kind of mental or emotional problem burdening the character, represented by a single word describing that feeling.

There's no expectation on anyone to "play out" these emotions. Players can bring their feelings into the foreground as little or as much as they want, but putting Conditions on display all the time is probably going to wear out the table.  The impact and presence of conditions are already woven into other mechanics: side effects and resolution moves.  It's okay to reserve your attention for those moments.

### Balancing Conditions

Like with any system, there are "better" and "worse" ways to engage with Conditions.  More ink gets spilled on that topic throughout this section.  For now, let's outline the general ideas.

#### PCs should have Conditions

Plain and simple.  A PC with 2-4 conditions is exactly where we want them to be.  If they have 0 or 1, the MC should go looking for ways to hit them hard.  If they have 4, it's up to that player to seek resolution, or to forge ahead and embrace **Breaking Their Limits**.

#### Having Conditions should only produce minor, narrative constraints

All but one of the conditions presented in this text avoid -1s for a very simple reason: persistent -1s suck the fun out of rolling.

Instead, asking the player to hold on to, say, three conditions whose triggers are so specific they might not come up at all?  That's a-okay.  The system still does what it needs to (gives the players a basis to talk about feelings while pushing characters towards a limit break).  And it's hopefully a bit of fun, once in a while, to act within constraints.

#### Clearing Conditions is not easy

If it gets too easy to clear out conditions we couldn't expect characters to keep any around.  
This is why moves like **Enjoy A Bonfire** require the choice between clearing conditions, healing injuries, and solving other problems.

#### Breaking Your Limit is a goal

EXP isn't easy to get in this game.  Hitting certain milestones- such as **Breaking Your Limit**- is one of the few ways to get more of it.  This single fact sets the tone for all the other design considerations in the mechanic.  Namely:

- Conditions should be present, but not punitive.
- They should escalate tension, but not lock anyone into a downward spiral.
- They should be more interesting to the conversation than the rolls.

### Maxing and Clearing Conditions

Conditions don't go away on their own.  You're stuck with them until they get resolved, whether directly or indirectly.

The most direct way to resolve a Condition is to use a move specifically designed for clearing them out, like **Comfort and Care**.  Like stated earlier, these moves should be rare in use and cost players some other opportunity.  The next best way is to get loaded with even more Conditions.

Each PC can live with up to 4 active Conditions.  When they take a fifth, they max out and **Break Their Limits**.

Hitting a limit break may sound a lot like "having a breakdown", but that isn't the intent.  The situation is, yes, supposed to represent a breaking point of some kind: too much stress or too much overload.  But much like regular conditions there's no requirement to focus the camera on it.  We're already going to do that with each playbook's **Limit Break**.

### List of Conditions

The following is an exploration of Conditions and their effects.  If you can't find the one you're you're looking for, or you think the listed effect isn't the right way to evoke the name, that's just fine.  Feel free to create your own as you go.  Keep in mind the goals: engaging with Conditions at large is more important than making sure each Condition is perfect.

- **Antagonized (pc)**: Name a PC.  You are unable to **Help Out** that ally.
- **Antagonized (npc)**: Name an NPC.  When you have a scene together, you _must_ lash out or attack them.
- **Addled**: You cannot **Defy Consequences** with **Intuit**.
- **Afraid**: Name a fear. Roll with _disadvantage_ if the thing you fear is nearby or front-of-mind.
- **Angry**: You may not use, or participate in, **Comfort and Care**.
- **Clumsy**: You cannot **Defy Consequences** with **Skill**.
- **Cold**: When you **Defeat an Adversary**, you must kill them.
- **Cowardly**: You may not **Interfere** if it involves taking Harm.
- **Desperate**: You cannot **Defy Consequences** with **Charm**.
- **Disinterested**: If any NPC attempts to escape from you, you must let them go safely.
- **Distracted**: Whenever you **Research the World**, your maximum success is capped at 1. (ie: you never get the 2+ outcome).
- **Guilty**: Pick a Debt. You may not take on additional Debts until that one is resolved.
- **Hopeless**: You are unable **Risk Everything**.
- **Insecure**: You are unable to **Doctor Injuries**.
- **Nervous**: You may only **Pressure Someone** by making a plea for their aid.
- **Obsessed**: Name what you become obsessed with. Gain the approach `Pursue your obsession`.
- **Obvious**: Roll with _disadvantage_ whenever you **Read the Room**.
- **Meek**: You may not inflict Harm.
- **Paranoid**: Whenever you **Dig Up A Secret**, in addition to your regular roll results, you always take the 0 case. (ie: follow your regular result, then also follow the 0 result.)
- **Reckless**: Gain the approach `Act without regard for the consequences`.
- **Restrained**: You may only **Defeat an Adversary** by allowing them to go free.
- **Unprepared**: You must spend 2 Supply to **Produce a Resource**.
- **Vicious**: You may only **Pressure Someone** by causing them Harm.
- **Weak**: You cannot **Defy Consequences** with **Force**.
- **Weary**: You cannot benefit from bonuses to your rolls (eg: advantage or +1s).

### Conditions and Safe Play

If you want to dive deeper and explore how your character works through, or lives with, a certain condition (or by **Breaking Their Limit**), that's great! I recommend that you first pause play and start a conversation about it with your table to discuss this want.  Talk about why you want to dig into with this exploration, what you'd like them to help you discover or reveal about your character, and ask if they'd like to help you navigate the topic.

Digging into conditions and breakpoints can be a lot of fun.  It can also be emotionally taxing and difficult to handle properly.  Remember to take breaks, review your safety tools, and talk it out as a group.

## Burdens

> Design note: This is a mechanic I may fill out in the future.  The general premise is that Conditions and Injury apply to an individual, while a Burden applies to the entire group.  The resolution mechanic and effects would have to change to fit.  The hope is that it gives the MC room to impose medium term effects like fatigue, loss of survival resources (rations and etc), being in a bad spot reputationally (though a reputation system might be better for that one).
