# The Doom

> Developer Note: This section is just a placeholder.  All that's written below are ideas about what I want, but no actual mechanics.

Every story needs an impending existential crisis.  The Doom is a way of putting a bigger threat on the horizon.  Something that could destabilize life and upend anything the table has come to love about the world they've built.

Not suggested as a session zero activity.  Actually it shouldn't appear until the table gets through an initial arc of some kind.  It would probably take that much time for them to conjure enough details about the dungeon to be able to put it at threat in a meaningful way. Any earlier than that and the doom would be toothless.

Once it's introduced, the MC has to start making Doom moves. Starting with the first sign of the Doom. Then with the forces of doom arriving at large. Finally, with the doom making its move against the dungeon.

This works as both a complicating through-line to whatever smaller plots the PCs are working on, as well as a signalled end of the game.  After all, a game like this can't carry on forever.  Nor should it. And an existential thread that looms over all feels like just the right way to bring everything to a close.
