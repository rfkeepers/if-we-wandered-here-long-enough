# Ecology

> Developer Note: This section is just a placeholder.  All that's written below are ideas about what I want, but no actual mechanics.

The dungeon ecology runs a bit like a faction game. The goal is to give the players a minigame where they can shift the influences and balance of power in the background. If you imagine the dungeon as a map laid out on a table, as if playing a wargame with little figurines to represent the major pieces (who is where, and what are they doing?), the ecology system is just that.  A set of little figurines to move around the map.

## Changing the Ecology

As part of the dungeon generation the table should come up with a handful of notable monsters, people, and groups.  The city, the great red dragon, the rival party, the science guild, the displaced orks, and so on.  Each of these is an ecology faction to track.

When the players **Enjoy a Bonfire**, part of the downtime requires that ecology factions make a move.  Moves here are probably simple: change their location, clash with another ecosystem, create or destroy something, etc. It should include a roll and a quick discussion about the ramifications.

Not all the Ecology factions make a move. It should be one-per-player. Enough to move the world a bit, but not so much that it becomes a chore.
