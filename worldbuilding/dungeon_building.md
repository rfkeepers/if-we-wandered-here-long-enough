> Whether Armilla is like this because it is unfinished or because it has been demolished, whether the cause is some enchantment or only a whim, I do not know. The fact remains that it has no walls, no ceilings, no floors: it has nothing that makes it seem a city except the water pipes that rise vertically where the houses should be and spread out horizontally where the floors should be: a forest of pipes that end in taps, showers, spouts, overflows. Against the sky a lavabo's white stands out, or a bathtub, or some other porcelain, like late fruit still hanging from the boughs. You would think that the plumbers had finished their job and gone away before the bricklayers arrived; or else their hydraulic systems, indestructible, had survived a catastrophe, an earthquake, or the corrosion of termites.

> Abandoned before or after it was inhabited, Armilla cannot be called deserted. At any hour, raising your eyes among the pipes, you are likely to glimpse a young woman, or many young women, slender, not tall of stature, luxuriating in the bathtubs or arching their backs under the showers suspended in the void, washing or drying or perfuming themselves, or combing their long hair at a mirror. In the sun, the threads of water fanning from the showers glisten, the jets of the taps, the spurts, the splashes, the sponges' suds.

> I have come to this explanation: the streams of water channeled in the pipes of Armilla have remained in the possession of nymphs and naiads. Accustomed to traveling along underground veins, they found it easy to enter the new aquatic realm, to burst from multiple fountains, to find new mirrors, new games, new ways of enjoying the water. Their invasion may have driven out the human beings, or Armilla may have been built by humans as a votive offering to win the favor of the nymphs, offended at the misuse of the waters. In any case, now they seem content, these maidens: in the morning you hear them singing.

# Building a Dungeon

> Developer Note: This section is just a placeholder.  All that's written below are ideas about what I want, but no actual mechanics.

A lot of the foundation of this game relies on the known parts of the dungeon.  Part of this would ideally include creation of literal maps. Primarily representing the initial city and floors.

What should a dungeon look like?  Personally, I prefer to imagine a shape similar to one of those anthills that get filled with aluminum.  Less a geometric stack of floors (as you might see on a classic map), more an organic collection of tendrils infected with a mass of shelves; almost jellyfish in nature.

It mustn't be either one. The table gets to choose. The ultimate goal is to condense all the weirdness of a landscape into a single place, with biomes distributed throughout floors. However the players achieve that is fair game.

Imagination unbound: the dungeon creation process would be its own minigame that takes one or more sessions to play out.  Something that could, if the table wants, get swapped out for a game of _Microscope_ or _The Quiet Year_ instead. 

## Tenets

The following tenets should apply to any dungeon your table generates:

1. The dungeon is ecologically robust and richly populated, no matter the aesthetic.
2. Dungeon "floors" are liminal spaces. They are not required to be "underground" in any meaningful aesthetic.  Nor does their size need to make sense in terms of euclidean space.  Oceans, voids, gravitational peculiarities... whatever.  It all goes.
3. The dungeon is inherently dangerous, but is not a literal set of traps and monsters.  This isn't OSR; we aren't in a survival race.

## The City

The first and most stable part of the dungeon: the city that sits on top of it. Although it get called a "city"- which implies a certain population- throughout this text, it can be as large or small as the table wants.  A little seaside town or forest village is just as good.  The only critical point here is that we have a spot of civilization crowning the entrance to the dungeon.

In the process of building the city we should find out:
- Who is considered the leader or ruler of the area?  Does that person claim the dungeon as part of their domain?
- How much attention does the Dungeon get in the wider world?  Is it relatively unknown, or a well-regarded landmark and tourist trap?
- Over the passage of time, how much has the city come to integrate with- and rely on- the dungeon?
- What external pressures are closing in on the city?
- What internal pressures are bubbling up in the city?

## 1-2: The Tame Floors

The first two floors are called the tame floors.  Much like the farmland surrounding a settlement, the city has grown downward and claimed the initial space in the dungeon for its own gain.  Here we should find communities, industries, and cultivation. 

In this part we should find out:
- What does the dungeon provide the city?  What about these goods is unique, unlike anything else in the world?
- What manners of socioeconomic stratifications exist between the city on the surface and the tame floors?
- What kinds of people choose to live and conduct business in the lower levels instead of on the surface?  What might compel them to do so?  What might force them to do so?

## 3-5: The Wild Floors

The following floors are wild spaces, full of things that prowl and snarl and stare.  People still travel to these floors, if infrequently, for recreation, sport, lifestyle, or rite of passage.  They all know it's dangerous, but they do it anyway.  And, yes, lives are lost down here.

The wild floors should tell us:
- What makes the dungeon dangerous?
- What especially notable monsters, people, or groups might the players run into here?
- What is worth finding in these places that you couldn't find higher up?
- What kind of person would you expect to find in these spaces?
- Which people or organizations are trying to push event deeper, despite the difficulty?

## 6+: The Unknown Floors

All this and below is unknown territory.  Totally untouched?  Not necessarily, that doesn't have to be the case.  But reliable information is difficult to come by; superstition and half-truths are all you get.

These floors aren't included in the generation game.  Leave them for when the players get there.
