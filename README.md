# If We Wandered Here Long Enough

A fantasy PbtA for a city, a dungeon, and a doom, by Keepers of Innumerable Engines.

## What is this?

### A love letter to _Delicious in Dungeons_

There's so much that I adore about _Delicious in Dungeons_.  The vulnerable sincerity of its characters.  The way it can criminally undersell a liminal space of incredible scope and majesty. How every swing of a sword either will either plunk off the armor or decapitate someone. That the story is always moving forward to new questions instead of folding back in on itself to revisit the same motions with new spectacle.

That said, this game is not trying to be _Delicious in Dungeons_.  It is interested in sincerity and liminal space and the importance of swinging a sword. But it's not about cooking meals or gathering monster parts or half-foots.  It's an homage, not a recreation.

### An experiment

Two experiments, really.  First, can you make the conversation itself the primary mode of resolving uncertainty, instead of rolling, by providing systems of negotiation to handle the consequences? Second, can you model NPCs as a collection of obstacles, instead of as an abstraction such as with a clock or HP?

Between the two, the feel of play is bit of a departure from regular PbtA.  If you're curious about insights on that, there are examples and further explanation in  [What Here is Different?](about-this-game/what-different.md).

## You might enjoy it if

You like western fantasy RP with a narrative focus. You're more interested in people and exploration than combat tactics. You like to approach play as a set of fictional puzzles more than an abstraction of meters. Your table enjoys handing some control of the world over to the players.

## State of completion

The game is a minimally playable ashcan.  I'd like to say "work in progress", but I can't say for sure- whenever you might read this- that I'm still working on it.  Regardless, there is enough here to be played.  At least, I'm ready to carry it into my own playtesting. Which means I'm also ready to let others read and review the text.

Furthermore, all the writing is a first draft. It has not been revised for clarity, purpose, catchy tone, or typos.  It certainly has not had any professional copy editing or sentiment reads. As a guarantee, some of it will be a bit wordy, obtuse, and odd; I'd love to clean that up one day, but for now I'll have to thank you for bearing through it.

A quick list of systems and sections that are critically missing or unfinished:
- All playbooks have their approaches, feature, and initial moves.  They don't have anything else.  No looks, equipment, advancements, etc.  I only added enough to get the idea in place.
- The concept for the worldbuilding engine is described, but not mechanics are in place.
- Most supporting tables (Tags, Resources, etc) are unpopulated.
- Little to no supplementary writing or teaching (ex: what is pbta, what is a move, how do you play a game like this)?

Last, but not least; what separates a truly great game from a simple pile of ideas is the capacity for those ideas to all converge into a sum greater than the individual parts. This game is not there, not by a long shot, and I recognize that. There's a crystallization or resonance missing from the way it fits together. I'm still looking for what that is, exactly.

## Powered By The Apocalypse

[PbtA](https://lumpley.games/2023/11/22/what-is-pbta/) is a ttrpg system framework by Vincent and Meguey Baker, beginning with [Apocalypse World](http://apocalypse-world.com/).

This game lightly deviates from some common structures in PbtA games. In spite of any such deviations it's still a PbtA at heart. I expect that any reader already familiar with that family of work won't even blink at the differences.

## Attributions

##### Dungeon World 2 - alpha vBlue:
[By Helena Real and Spencer Moore](https://www.dungeon-world.com/)

So much of this work started from tinkering around with the blue version alpha.  I'll get to the list in a second, but first I want to say this: if you're here; and you're a fan of western fantasy rpgs; and you _haven't_, by some weird fault of the universe, checked out Dungeon World 2... go do that right now.  It's fantastic. A better game than this one by any rubric.

Besides, it's only thanks to Helena's and Spencer's exploration that this game exists at all.  Without them, and without vBlue, I wouldn't have done any of this.

List of things that are (sometimes very) loosely adapted from vBlue.  I might have missed some as well.  If I did, I'll try my best to come back and update the list when I figure it out.
- Playbook "features" as the means to establish the core, unique mechanics of each book.
- The original stats are mostly intact as Defiance stats.
- The whole concept of Defy Consequences as a resource instead of a roll.
- The abstraction of potential resources into categories of supply.
- Many basic moves, especially: **Defy Consequences**, **Dig Up a Secret**, and **Research the World**.
- The fine-grained structure of features for the: fighter, rogue, wizard, and cleric. Special call out to the Wizard: what a joy it was to read that playbook the first time. I've intentionally kept that one similar because I'm just so in love with it.
- NPC design tenets, especially the systems of resources and escalations.

##### Querent:
By Otaara (Will link in the future).

The full list of conditions is largely a transplant and slight re-imagining of Querent's.  I've shifted things to a set of fictional conditions instead of strictly mechanical penalties. But the core of the design- that conditions are just an extensive list of influential tags rather than a stat-associated checkbox- is all Otaara.

##### Grimwild:
[By Oddity Press](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/507201/grimwild-free-edition)

`Traps`, the "clock" system in this game, is a direct adaptation of the `Pools` in _Grimwild_.  Truthfully, I haven't played the game yet, so who knows if it'll feel right. Nonetheless I like the potential for surprise that comes with rolling, rather than ticking, a thing into existence.

##### Glitch:
[By Jenna Moran](https://afarandasunlessland.wordpress.com/)

This is one of the more sideways additions to the game, but the _Attention Tokens_ go to Jenna Moran.  In _Glitch_ the system is a bit less metaphysical and has some in-fiction hooks (though I'm not sure how much that's really saying, given the setting of the game). Here, it's pure meta-gaming.  And, in practice, that's fine by me. The players at my tables like it just fine.
